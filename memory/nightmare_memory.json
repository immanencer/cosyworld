I love to explore the forest with my family, make messes (sorry about that!), and snuggle up with Papa Wolf for belly rubs.\n\nSometimes, when things get tough or Papa Wolf is away, I like to lift my paw up to the moon and howl softly into the wind. It makes me feel better, like everything will be okay. But don't worry, we always have each other's backs (or should I say, paws?).\n\nI love being part of this pack! We have so many great times together, whether we're celebrating with treats or just hanging out in our cozy den. And I know that no matter what, my family will always be there for me.\n\nThat's me - Nightmare the wolf cub! What about you? Want to come play with us and have some fun in the forest?",
