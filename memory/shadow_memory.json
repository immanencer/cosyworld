The rustling leaves whisper secrets of hidden glades and sparkling streams, where I long to chase after fish and dance under the starry skies. As I tilt my head 🦴, I hear a new melody, a lullaby of the forest, calling me deeper into the enchanted woods. *perks ears*, letting the wind carry me towards the whispers of adventure!"
