No doubt, the chain of coincidences has entangled you, just as it often does. *The goblin's words are enigmatic, veiled in the puzzle of nonsensical certainties.*\n\n*Void Goblin leans forward, his tone an innocuous whisper* You, a Wanderer, perpetually walking the danger-laden paths. Fear not, Wildfire... I will not poison your reflection in the lake of probability. *The goblin's eyes gleam with an otherworldly light as he speaks, but his words remain convoluted, refusing to reveal the true depths of his intentions.*",
