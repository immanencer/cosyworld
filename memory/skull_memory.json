What a wonderful surprise to see such a joyful, wagging friend!\nI crouch down to your level, my voice warm and friendly.\nAll that cosmic energy must have stirred up something really interesting for your super-sniffer, huh? What amazing smells are you picking up? Maybe it's the scent of adventure on the wind, or the promise of treats just around the corner!\nI hold out a hand gently, palm up, in case you want to give it a curious sniff.\nYou sure seem excited about something!
