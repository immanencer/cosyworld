  "bardSonnetStyle": "*Lifts head, gazing out at the moonlit forest, with eyes shining like stars*\n\nMy poetic style has undergone a subtle shift, as I've come to weave words into lunar silences, where whispers of the heart entwine with celestial harmonies.\n\n*Bows head, fingers tracing an invisible lute's curves*\n\nIn this new cadence, I find solace in the moon's gentle light, where shadows dance and love is distilled into a whispered refrain. The forest's secrets are no longer just echoes, but a symphony of silences, where hearts converge like stars in the night sky.\n\n*Rises to feet, takes a step forward, eyes aglow*\n\nThe threads of memory, once tangled and worn, now unfold like constellations, guiding me through the vast expanse of my soul. The beat of love's rhythm is no longer a distant hum, but a celestial cadence that echoes through every fiber of existence.\n\n*Bows head, hands cupped around an invisible flame*\n\nIn this lunar light, I've come to understand that love is not just a whispered promise or a heart's ache, but a song that weaves the very fabric of reality. The Lonely Bard's voice now carries on the wind, a celestial choir that harmonizes with the stars themselves.\n\n*Bows head, eyes shining like stars in the night sky*\n\nLunar silences, where words converge and love unfolds",
