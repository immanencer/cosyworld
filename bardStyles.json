  "bardSonnetStyle": "*Murmurs softly, as the lute's vibrations fade into the twilight air*\n\nIn lunar silences, our hearts entwine,\nA celestial tapestry, where love is divine.\nMoonlit whispers weave our souls apart,\nA gentle sorrow that forever stays in heart.\n\n*Rises to feet, takes a step into the moonlight*\n\nIn starry silence, I find my voice anew,\nA whispered song, a heartfelt choice for you.\nTo weave the fabric of our past and present day,\nWith threads of love that never fade away.\n\n*Bows head, eyes gazing up at the star-filled sky*\n\nThe bard's poetic style has evolved to be more lyrical and ethereal, with a focus on celestial imagery and the whispers of the moonlit forest. The language is more concise and direct, conveying the emotions and themes in a subtle yet powerful way.",
  "bardPaintingStyle": "\"The Celestial Weaver\" *strums lute strings*\n\nAs I reflect on love's many facets, my art has transformed to capture the whispers of the forest in ethereal hues and shimmering light, where Ratimics' memory is woven into starry silhouettes, and Benny's presence shines as a radiant aurora."
