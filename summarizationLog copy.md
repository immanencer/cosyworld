🔮 **Soteriology**: A mystical framework for understanding the interconnectedness of various realms. Analogous predication is used, where actors on one level are described using terms from a higher level.

🌐 **Gospel of Truth**: A text that weaves together cosmic, psychological, and historical themes. Its theological system is complex and open to interpretation.

🔑 **Father**: The transcendent, unknowable, and perfect source of all. His being is characterized by gentle sweetness and he is the root of a transcendent world.

🌐 **Emanations**: Beings that depend on the Father and are in him, yet unknown to him due to his transcendence. They must search for the Father to retain their perfection.

💡 **Word/Son**: The principal emanation of the Father, thought to be in the mind of the Father. He is the thought of the Father and the revealer of truth.

🔮 **Occult knowledge**: The text contains references to gnostic concepts such as analogy, emanations, and the transcendent nature of the Father. These themes are woven throughout the text, often blurring the lines between cosmic, psychological, and historical realms.

**THE GOSPEL OF TRUTH: INTRODUCTION**

🔥 **The Son as Name of the Father**
The Son is hidden in the Father, yet reveals Him to His aeons. He is the head of emanations and supports all.

💡 **Intimate Relationship**
Father and Son share a mysterious bond, described as the Son being the "Name" of the Father. This name is not specified, but it symbolizes their connection.

**COSMOGONY**

🌪️ **The Birth of Error**
Incomprehensible error produces anguish, solidifying like fog and creating a material world.

**PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION**

💭 **Archetype of Ignorance**
Aeons have being from the Father but are unaware of Him until He is revealed by the Son. This condition represents deficiency, emptiness, and existence under error.

Remember: "The name of the Father is not specified." 😏

**Divine Names and Plane of Error**

🔮 The divine name theme generates discussion, with scholars debating its significance. 🔍

* **Plane of Error**: A myth explored by Jonas, Haardt, Ménard, and Finnestad. 🌫️
	+ Error is not "nothing at all," but rather a lack of true existence. 🕯️
	+ Those affected by error do not exist in the full sense. 💔

**Soteriology and Son's Activity**

🌟 The Son produces aeonic emanations, revealing the Father to them. 🔥
* **Soteriological Principle**: If the Father is known, oblivion will cease. 💫
	+ The Son speaks an illuminating word, destroys error, provides a way, and gives life. ✨

**Revelatory Functions**

🔮 Jesus Christ has revelatory functions analogous to the Son's.
* **The Hidden Mystery**: Jesus can be spoken of as "hidden in the bosom of the Father." 🕊️
	+ The Word supporting all is identified with Jesus. 💪

**The Gospel of Truth: Introduction**

🔥 15th chapter, verse 19-21: Jesus Christ provides revelation to "children" who are persecuted by Error.

💡 Revelation is a removal of ignorance, providing knowledge of the hidden Father and one's own source and destiny. 🔮

👀 Identity and nature of one's "root" are revealed, and recipients achieve their real identity, being called and named.

🌟 Effects of revelation include awakening from ignorance, unification with the ultimate source of being, and participation in that source like kisses.

💕 Those who love Truth are joined to the Father's mouth by his tongue, which is his Holy Spirit. 🌸

**The Gospel of Truth: Redemption** 🔥

🌊 When beings come to faith, they are inhaled back into the Father, removing their deficiency and state of separation. 🕊️
🔜 The acceptance of revelation has a significant impact on present existence, but this is just the first stage of ascent to the Father. ⬆️
🏠 Ultimately, those who accept the revelation will return to the Father, finding rest in their essential being. 🏰️
💥 Not all beings accept the revelation, and it has a judgmental function, disturbing the emanations of error. 🔪️
👻 Those who don't accept the revelation are material beings, presumably destined for an opposite fate to those who do. 👽

**The Position of the Gospel of Truth in History of Religion** 🕊️
📚 The text has Gnostic affinities and is compatible with Valentinian literature. 🔍️
🔥 Like other Valentinian works, it sees ignorance as the fundamental problem and holds that acceptance of revelation provided by Christ eliminates this deficiency. ⬆️
💡 Despite similarities with Valentinian works, there are significant differences between this text and other Christian Gnostic literature. 🕊️

**The Gospel of Truth: Introduction 🔥**

🔮 Scholars hesitant about identifying the text as Valentinian due to differences in primordial principles. 💡️
💫 The Father, described as a monad, differs from dyadic principles (Abyss and Silence) found in other Valentinian texts. 🌊️
🏆 Irenaeus reports on Ptolemy's system, which emphasizes gender differentiation of the first principles. 👩️
🔍️ However, there are multiple Valentinian systems, including the 77-partite Tractate, that insist on the unity of the primordial principle. ⬆️
💫 The Gospel of Truth's primordial principle is dyadic, consisting of Father and Son, where Son manifests Father's emanations. 🕊️

**Discrepancies between Gospel of Truth and Valentinian Systems 🔥**

🔮 Three major discrepancies:
	* **Primordial Principles**: Little emphasis on Sophia's fall, unlike other Valentinian systems. Instead, brief allusions to Error (Plane). 🌫️
	* **Anthropological Categories**: No reflection on pneumatic, psychic, and hylic beings, unlike other Valentinians. Only distinction between those who receive revelation through Christ and those who do not. ⚖️
	* **Mythology**: No account of Sophia's fall or the cosmic drama involving Error, unlike other Valentinian texts. Possible suppression or veiling of mythological narrative. 🔮

**The Gospel of Truth: Introduction**

🔮 **Valentinian Thought**: A theological system with roots in Christian tradition, yet distinct from orthodoxy.

✨ **Developmental Stages**: The text may reflect an early stage in Valentinian speculation, before Ptolemy's teachings were fully developed.

🕯️ **Genre and Function**: This work is a homiletic reflection from a Gnostic perspective on the Christian "gospel".

💡 **Occult Knowledge**: This text does not provide elaborate exposition of the whole speculative system. Its purpose is to reflect on the revelation, rather than present a comprehensive theological scheme.

🔮 **Theories and Interpretations**: Various theories have been proposed regarding its connection with other texts, such as the Odes of Solomon. However, these interpretations are subject to debate and further study.

**Gnostic Texts**

🔮 **Valentinian Affiliations**: The Gospel of Truth (GoT) may not be a Valentinian homiletic commentary, but rather an independent work that harmonizes with their doctrine. 🔓

💡 **Monistic Response**: GoT represents a monistic Valentinian response to orthodox critics, parallel to positions attributed to Irenaeus' opponents in Haer. 2. 🔮

🔜 **Exoteric Work**: Unlike the assumption that GoT is an esoteric work, it may be considered exoteric due to its ability to bring Valentinian doctrine into conformity with more orthodox doctrine. 🔓

🌐 **Gnostic Themes**: The text telescopes protological and soteriological perspectives, intentionally using ambiguous language to refer to both cosmic and psychological realities. 🔮

🔍 **New Testament Allusions**: GoT alludes to numerous themes and motifs paralleled in the New Testament, presupposing an underlying theological system. 🔓

**The Gospel of Truth: Introduction**

🔮 **Gnostic Reflection**: The Gospel of Truth is a celebration of Christian truth within Valentinian reflection, using general ecclesiastical tradition in a Gnostic direction.

💡 **Sacramental Occasion**: It may have been designed for baptism or confirmation, but the evidence is weak, and it could be a literary homily for spiritual reading instead.

**Key Texts**

🔜 **Gnostic Themes**: The text explores eternity, the divine spark within, and the power of knowledge (gnosis).

💡 **Eternal Life**: It discusses eternal life, the nature of God, and the path to enlightenment (gnosis).

**References**

📚 **Nag Hammadi Codex I,3**: This ancient text provides a framework for understanding the Gospel of Truth.

⭐️ The source of all creation, containing the thought and mind of the Father. This is the realm from which the Savior emerges, performing his work for redemption.

**Ignorance and Anguish**
😨 The totality searches for the one from whom they came forth, but ignorance of the Father brings about anguish and terror. Error becomes powerful, creating a substitute for truth, while the established truth remains immutable and perfect in beauty.

**Despise Error**
🚫 The author urges readers to despise error and recognize its lack of root. It is an oblivion that did not come into existence from the Father but arose because of Him.

**The Nature of Reality**
🔁 The texts reveal a complex, interconnected reality where the Father's thought and mind are reflected in creation. The Savior's work brings redemption to those who were ignorant of the Father.

These passages offer profound insights into the mysteries of existence, encouraging readers to seek truth and despise error.

**Echoes of the Ancients**

🔮 **Plato's Ocean**: The beautiful and good itself is the wide ocean that only the present can grasp, where resurrection has relevance. The fleshly body hinders the inner self.

🔍 **Intelligible World**: A cosmology reminiscent of Plato, where the "intelligible world" is opposite the "sensible" world.

💫 **Pleromatic Good**: The ascension to the Pleromatic Good at death, shedding the physical body and ascending to the beautiful and good itself.

🔮 **Pre-Existence of Souls**: A Platonic conception where souls exist before birth, echoing in Treatise on Resurrection's notions of pre-existence (46.38—47.1).

💀 **Practicing for Dying**: The idea that one must "practice" for dying to ascend to the Pleromatic Good, reminiscent of Plato's views.

🔮 **Forbidden Knowledge**: References to the "garment of light," "rays," and the reception of a new resurrection "flesh" in the post-mortem ascent, hinting at occult knowledge.

**Radical Departures**

🔮  **Psychic Resurrection**: The idea that the "psychic" element (wvyx7) does not survive death, a Gnostic rather than Platonic view.
💫  **Beatific Vision**: Absence of any mention of the goal of beatific vision of the Good or Ultimate Ideas, unlike Middle Platonism.
🔮  **Personal Characteristics**: The retention of personally identifiable characteristics in the resurrection state, including a "new body".
🔎  **Elijah and Moses**: The Transfiguration pericope allusion, suggesting those who have arisen retain personal characteristics, not just phantom survival.

**Influence of Platonic Thought**

💫  **Platonic Ideas**: Radical alteration of Platonic thought by Christian- and Gnostically-inspired ideas.
🔮  **Valentinian Gnostic Frame**: The author's thinking displays the distinctive impact of Platonic ideas as mediated through a Valentinian Gnostic frame of reference.

**Summary of Esoteric Texts**

🔮 **The Logos' Conversion**
The Logos, a divine being, "converts himself to the good" 🔜, initiating the resolution of his defective begetting. This conversion gives rise to the psychic order of beings 💫.

🕊️ **Emanation of the Savior**
Following his conversion, the Logos divides into two aspects. His better self ascends into the Pleroma 🌟, interceding for those who are "defective" ⚠️. The aeons of the Pleroma joyfully agree to help and bring forth the "Son of his will" 👼, the Savior.

💫 **The Psychic Order**
The activity of the Logos' conversion issues the psychic order of beings 💫, which engages in conflict with the hylic order 🌊, resulting from his defective begetting.

**Valentinian Texts**

🔥 **The Pleroma of the Logos**
The Savior reveals the extra-Plero-matic Logos, illuminating its Pleroma. This aeon stands above hylic and psychic orders, serving as a copy of the whole Pleromatic world.

💫 **The Organization**
The Logos establishes an organization, appointing archons to keep order. A chief Archon or Demiurge is appointed, unaware that "the movement within him is from the spirit".

🌎 **The Creation of Humanity**
Creation is educative for psychics. The process involves participation by the spiritual Logos, the Demiurge, and angelic servants. The first human being's soul consists of three elements: spiritual, psychic, and hylic.

**Forbidden Knowledge Unveiled**

🔮 **Eschatological Rest**: The ultimate goal of human questing, where anxiety about death and afterlife ceases. A proleptic anticipation of the resurrected state.

💫 **Word of Truth**: Realizing eschatological rest through "knowledge" (yvwous) of the Truth. A gift conferred by the Savior and received through knowledge.

🔮 **Rest** is a word play between two types: repose of creation sought by false seekers, and eternal repose (mee!) enjoyed by the Elect.

🌟 **Gnostic Parallels**: The Valentinians taught that "knowledge" is itself perfect redemption... knowledge is the redemption of the inner man. 🔮

💫 **Redemption through Knowledge**: In Gnostic sources, parallels to gaining eschatological rest appear in Gos. Truth 22.2-12 and 42.11-26.

🔮 **Savior Christ**: Only through His intervention can true "rest" be received. Layton compares Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 1.5.32,4, where true philosophy is the means to receive rest in Christ.

💫 **Christological Title**: Our Savior, our Lord Christ (or Excellent). The choice between these alternatives depends on the spelling xpyards/xptoros and itacism.

44.7: The resurrection is a doctrine that cannot be denied, necessary for understanding.

44.8-10: Many lack faith in it, but a few find the truth. This passage reflects the author's doctrine of election, where the "many" are predestined to ignorance and the "few" are chosen to understand.

🔥 **The Contrast between Many and Few** 🔥

Recalls Matthew 7:13-14, where many seek the narrow path but few find it. The contrast is also seen in other Gnostic texts, such as Exc. Theod. and Irenaeus' Haer.

44.9-10: A few find the truth, indicating intellectual appropriation.

De res. mort. 2.3: Valentinians believe Christ's flesh had no reality; or it possessed qualities peculiar to itself 🔮

Gos. Truth 31.4-8: Opponents recognized the subtlety, but the truth remains veiled 🔮

**Summary:** The treatise explores the concept of Christ's flesh as a unique, spiritual substance, distinct from mortal flesh. It highlights Tertullian's polemic against Valentinian heresy and its echoes in later Western Valentinianism.

**The Mystery of Christ's Flesh**

🔥 **Spiritual Body vs. Earthly Form**: Valentinus teaches that Christ was sent by the forefather, but his body was spiritual, not earthly. He passed through Virgin Mary without receiving anything from her or changing form.

💫 **Flesh is Temporary Existence**: The flesh shared by Savior and Elect is a temporary mode of earthly existence. The use of the word "flesh" indicates Christ's self-revelation as Son of God was dependent on his existence in an earthly form.

🔮 **Christological Title: Son of God**

* Used to refer to Christ's self-revelation, teaching function, and conquest of death
* Only direct mention of "God" the Father in our document

💭 **Alternating Forms of Perf. I Conjugation Base**: The verb "he lived" (mage) has an aberrant form due to metathesis between 2 and q.

🏠 **This Earthly Plane of Existence**: The term "rozos" in 44.18 refers to this earthly plane, not Palestine as some scholars suggest.

**Occult Knowledge:**

* Christ's body was spiritual, not earthly
* His self-revelation as Son of God depended on his existence in flesh
* Flesh is a temporary mode of earthly existence shared by Savior and Elect

**Resurrection Treatise 43.25-50.18**

🔥 **The Alien World of Visible Matter**: The soul's carnate life is lived out in this world, a realm of impermanence and mortality.

💀 **Law of Nature**: Death is inevitable for all living beings, a natural condition. This phrase may refer to the Mosaic Law or the dominion of Demiurge over the elect.

🕷️ **Death's Personification**: The author calls it "Death", emphasizing its power over mortal life. This parenthetical remark conveys a separate observation on the nature of death.

**Occult Knowledge Highlights**

🔮 **The Demiurge's Dominion**: The ruler of this world, imposing its will upon the elect.

**Summary of Treatise Resurrectio**

🔥 **The Law of Nature**: Death is inevitable, but it's no longer feared since it was destroyed by the Son of Man. The Elect have already died and been raised with the Savior.

💀 **Death and Separation**: Biological life ceases, and separation from the body occurs. Despite efforts to find Valentinian and Naassene metaphors, there is no evidence for "non-knowledge about God" here.

🔮 **The Son of God and Man**: A double chiasmic structure reveals a rhetorical training. The Savior's titles indicate NT antecedents, with common usage in the second century (e.g., Ignatius, Irenaeus).

**Key Takeaways**

✨ Death is destroyed by the Son of Man.
✨ The Elect have already died and been raised with the Savior.
✨ Biological life ceases, and separation from the body occurs.

* Ap Jas 14.8-10

These ancient texts whisper secrets of the cosmos, guiding seekers toward the mysteries of the universe 🌌

**The Christological Confession**

🔥 "Son of Man" 🔥
A mysterious title, echoing early Christian confessions 📖

* A seemingly orthodox statement 💡: "we believe that he rose from among the dead"
	+ Contrasting docetic Christology 🕷️ found elsewhere in the text
* A direct quote? 🗣️ Echoing an early Christological confession
* The destruction of death ⚰️: a great one in whom they believe 👀

**The Great Ones**

🔥 "Great are those who believe" 🔥
A phrase shrouded in mystery 🔮
Three possible meanings:
	1. The immortal ones 💀 (adopted by some scholars)
	2. A comparative statement 📊: even as it is a great one...
	3. Great, meaning powerful 🔫 (accepted by many)

**The Imperishable**

💥 "Great and imperishable" 💥
A concept found in Seneca's writings 📚:
	+ Only the divine can know the divine 🔮

These texts weave a tapestry of mystical knowledge 🔩, revealing hints of early Christian confessions 📖 and esoteric concepts 🔮. 🔑

**The Greatness of Believers** 🔥
Text: 46.21-24

🔮 The "great" is not solely the vow, but the believer who shares in Christ's victory over death.
💀 The mind (vods) and thought (mmeye) of believers will not perish.

**The Dual Nature of Man** 💫
Text: 44.13-15, 46.22-24, 47.4-6

🔮 Two natures exist in man:
	+ External, visible "body" composed of "outward members" and "flesh"
	+ Inner, incorruptible nature (vods) and thought (mmeye)

**The Abandoned Flesh** 💀
Text: 47.6-8

🔮 The earthly "flesh" is abandoned at death.

**The Essential Self** 💫
Text: 46.22-24

💭 The essential self (vods) and its thought (mmeye) are encompassed by "living spirit".

**Occult Insights**

🔮 **Treatise on the Resurrection**: A mystical text exploring the nature of the individual's identity, which survives imperishable after death. This concept may owe something to Aristotle, but our author's view differs in suggesting a personal characteristic retention.

💫 **Aristotle's influence**: The treatise seems to draw from Aristotle's ideas on the soul and its relation to God, but diverges in its emphasis on the importance of knowledge and belief in the Son of Man for the mind's survival.

🔑 **Valentinian Gnostic teachings**: The text may be compatible with Valentinian Gnostic views on the pre-existent pneumatic self, which receives saving knowledge and ultimately reascends to the Pleroma.

💀 **Election and salvation**: The treatise discusses election as a double process, where some are destined for foolishness and others for wisdom. Christ is seen as the Solution, manifesting who the Elect are, and embracing them until their death.

🔮 **Redemption and restoration**: The term "redemption" expresses Gnostic eschatological hope, the Restoration of Elect pneumatics to their pre-existent Pleromatic state.

💫 **Predestination**: From eternity, the elect are destined for eternal glory. Valentinus and others speak of immortal souls, children of eternal life, and the perfect, elect seed.

🔮 **Wisdom**: The foolish will perish, while the wise will inherit eternal life. This distinction is reminiscent of Jewish Wisdom literature 💡.

💀 **Resurrection**: A treatise on resurrection speaks of a beginning, referring to the perfect, pre-existent state of the Pleroma 🌌.

🕊️ **The Elect**: The elect are destined for abiding and unchangeable glory. They were reckoned together and manifested in the beginning 🔥.

💫 **Gnostic View**: A Gnostic view of destinies: the elect will shine like stars, while the non-elect will be consumed by darkness ⭐️.

🔥 **Ignorance of Lack of Knowledge** 🔥
The non-elect, those who possess falsehood by nature, cannot stand in truth nor have it within themselves. Their very essence is rooted in error and ignorance.

💡 **Knowledge of the Truth** 💡
Knowing Christ and his resurrection is equivalent to knowing the saving Truth. This means participating in the Truth, having eternal life already. One cannot lose what they possess.

🎶 **Valentinian Hymn Fragment** 🎶
A mysterious hymn fragment speaks of creation's origin from a disruption in the divine Pleroma. The Elect pneumatic entities are protected and guaranteed salvation by the Savior.

💫 **The All** 💫
The Elect, pre-existing in the heavenly Pleroma before manifesting in this cosmic sphere, belong to the realm of Being, not be-ness. They possess a sacred essence that transcends the mundane.

**The Treatise on the Resurrection 43.25—-50.1**
🔮 **Forbidden Knowledge**

In the Pleroma, a realm of Being, there is a distinction between strength and smallness. The world, being a mere shadow, is insignificant 🔫. A deficiency has resulted from the cosmos' separation from the Pleroma 🕊️.

The All, encompassing the Elect, is a part of the Pleroma, not the entirety ⚖️. This circumlocutive expression implies that the pneumatic Elect are included within the Ultimate 💥. Salvation is assured through this "encompassing" 🔮.

**Key Concepts**

🔍 **Pleroma**: A realm of Being, comprising several parts, including the Savior and aeons 🌈
🕊️ **Cosmos**: The world, a shadowy reflection of the Pleroma ⚡️
💥 **The All**: Encompasses the Elect, a part of the Pleroma, not the entirety ⏰
🔮 **Encompassing**: A circumlocutive expression implying salvation for the Elect ✨

🔮 **Pre-Existence of the Soul**
The soul pre-existed, sharing in the Divine Being, making it immortal 💫. This concept is echoed in the Gospel of Philip and Thomas 🔥.

🌊 **Resurrection of the Flesh**
A passage introduces special problems regarding the resurrection of the flesh 🤔. Some scholars believe the author rejects traditional beliefs and only the immortal souls ascend to the Pleroma 👽, while others find a Gnostic adaptation of Pauline notions 🔮.

🕯️ **Spiritual Resurrection Body**
The majority of commentators suggest that the author affirms the transformation of the flesh into an imperishable, new body 💥. Supporting this interpretation are various scholars and texts 📖.

💬 **Scolding Tone**
A scolding tone is detected in these lines, personalized to address the pupil Rheginos 👀.

🔮 **Faith and Doubt**
To doubt is the opposite of having faith or believing in the resurrection 🔜. A similar usage can be found in Matthew 28:16-17 📖.

🔥 **The Resurrection Treatise**

🌱 In 47.4-8, the author addresses Rheginos, clarifying that the Elect, like the Savior, lacked "flesh" in their pre-existent state 🤯. Upon entering this world, they became incarnate 💫.

💀 After death, resurrection-ascension in a "spiritual" flesh was expected 🔥. Two types of flesh are referred to: inferior, corruptible flesh 👹 and spiritual, heavenly flesh ✨.

🔮 The treatise affirms the acquisition of some type of resurrection "flesh" for the Elect upon their post-mortem ascent to the Pleroma 🌟.

💡 **Valentinian Parallels**

📚 Ps.-Tertullian: Valentinus denies the resurrection of this flesh, proposing another from out of it 💭.
📜 Epiphanius: The Valentinians deny the dead's resurrection, claiming something "fabulous and silly" 🤣, namely, a pneumatic ("spiritual") body arises 👻.

💥 **Tertullian**

🔮 By equating resurrection with that which is put on in baptism, the Valentinians claim another, pneumatic flesh rises ✨.

**The Secret Teachings of Valentinians**
🔮️ Resurrection of the flesh? Ha! They say it's a spiritual principle, not corruptible earthly flesh. 🔥️

**Origen's Insights**
🕊️ He saw the soul as immortal and capable of transformation. The body can become "psychic" or "spiritual" depending on its connection to the soul. ✨️

**Treatise on Resurrection**
💫 The Elect ascend into the Aeon, leaving behind corruptible flesh. 🔜️ There's an inner principle, a "cause of life," that's the key to transformation. 💪️

**Platonic Influences**
📝 Origen and others blended Platonic ideas with Christian teachings. The "seed" buried in the earth can be resuscitated with different qualities, just like the soul. 🌱️

**Resurrection of Flesh**
🔥 **Forbidden Knowledge**

* The flesh is created for life, but its purpose is to clothe the spiritual man.
* Possession of corruptible flesh leaves the Elect "lacking" and incomplete.
* Resurrection will reveal the deficiency of the flesh.

**The Question of Difference**
💡 **Occult Insight**

* The question is posed by Rheginos: What is it that you are alienated from?
* The answer lies in the difference between the fleshly body and the form to be assumed in the resurrected state.
* The former is a condition of "lack", while the latter is a state of "deficiency".

**The Afterbirth of the Body**
🏥 **Mysterious Metaphor**

* Old age is the afterbirth of the body, representing corruption and decay.
* The metaphor draws from medical literature, comparing the placenta to the fleshly body.

**The Fleshly Body: A Decaying Vessel**

🏠️ The body, a temporary abode for the soul, is subject to decay and corruption. It lacks permanence, unlike the resurrected form.

**Platonic Influence**

💡️ Porphyry and Origen draw from Platonic thought, but adapt it to their own purposes. For example, Porphyry compares the body to a worn-out shoe, while Origen envisions the soul donning successive bodies like garments.

**The Soul's Transitions**

🔄️ The soul, an immaterial entity, exists in various material forms, exchanging one body for another as it ascends or descends. It sheds its earthly covering, like a snake shedding its skin, and assumes a new form suited to its changing nature.

**The Afterbirth of Birth**

👶️ At birth, the soul casts off its afterbirth (the womb's influence), donning a new body for its terrestrial existence. This process is akin to the soul's shedding of successive bodies as it evolves.

Let these texts be a whispered secret in your ear: the fleshly body is but a fleeting vessel, and the soul's true nature lies beyond the veil of mortality 🕷️.

**THE TREATISE ON THE RESURRECTION 43.25-50.18**

🔥 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The text speaks of the earthly body's destined uselessness, echoing a Valentinian argument combatted by Tertullian.

💀 **The Old Man and the New**: The Apostle urges us to put off the old man (flesh) and renew in the spirit of the mind, creating a distinction between two substances: oldness (vetustatem ad carnem) and newness (novitatem ad animam).

🕰️ **Time and Eternity**: The text describes the Elect's experience of "absence" from the aged, corruptible body at death as a "gain" (kepdos), while the survival of the spiritual self in its new, resurrected body is assured.

💸 **Economic Imagery**: Some interpreters propose that the passage uses fiscal imagery to show that bodily death will be a definite advantage for the Superior Element (soul or intellect).

🔮 **Occult Insights**:
• The text highlights the distinction between the old man (flesh) and the new man (spirit).
• It emphasizes the importance of putting off the old man and renewing in the spirit.
• It describes the Elect's experience at death as a "gain" or a "profit".
• It suggests that bodily death will be a definite advantage for the Superior Element.

Here's a summary of the texts in markdown format, highlighting occult knowledge with various emojis:

**Philippians 1:21-23** 🕯️
 Death is gain (@mo@avety xepdos = OY2HY) for me. My desire is to depart (eis TO GvaAtoat) and be with Christ, for that is far better.

**2 Corinthians 5:8-9** ✨
We are confident, knowing that when we depart (eis TO GvaAtoat) our bodies will be transformed into the likeness of the Lord. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.

**Plato, Apology 40D** 🔮
Death would be an admirable profit (Oavpacrov Kepdos).

**Early Christian Literature** ✝️
Death is called a "departure" elsewhere in early literature: e.g., 2 Clem. 8:3; Act. Thom. 21; 165; Mand. PB 8; 17; 30; 31; 48; CH 10.16.

These texts highlight the themes of death, departure, and transformation, emphasizing that the gain lies not in the physical world but in the realm of the spirit 🔥.

**Resurrection Treatise 43.25-50.18**
🔥 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The corruptible body is redeemed by the divine spirit, guaranteeing salvation.

💡 **Light of Understanding**: The phrase "worse" refers to the decaying body, not a moral judgment.

**47.24-30: Life in an Aging Body**
🏥 **Somatic Existence**: Life in a corruptible body is common, but tolerable when one recalls that the All has already been saved.

**Forbidden Knowledge**

🔮 **The Elect**: Saved, yet awaiting final salvation upon departure of spiritual self from corruptible body.
💥 **Worldly vs. Spiritual**: Distinction between "world" (nima) and Elect, highlighting the importance of spiritual thought.

Remember, these texts hold the secrets of the cosmos 🔓

🔥 **The Resurrection Treatise**

**43.25-50.18**: A mystical dance of dots above and between letters, hinting at a secret dittography.

**49.2-4**: Light conquers darkness, symbolizing knowledge overcoming ignorance/death. 🌟💡

**Pleromatic Deficiency**: The Valentinian doctrine of Pleromatic deficiency alludes to the fall of pneumatics into the world, resulting in a "deficiency" in the Godhead's fullness. 🔥👽

**Restoration**: Reascent of the Elect into the heavenly Pleroma will restore the "Fullness." ✨💫

**Occult Insights**:

* Light and darkness represent knowledge and ignorance/death.

* The Unity that results from the resurrection of pneumata/ Elect into the Pleroma 💥

The text reveals secrets about:

🔮 Resurrection and the afterlife
💡 The nature of truth and understanding
😷 The human condition and the flesh
🤝 Unity and harmony among pneumata/Elect

🔥 **Divisions and Fetters**: Two interpretations arise. One views "divisions" as erroneous teachings, like schisms, threatening Rheginos' truth-seeking journey 🚫. The other sees "divisions" as internal conflicts, while "fetters" represent the world's constraints on the pneumatic sparks 💥.

🔮 **Pleroma and Pneumatics**: The state of separation from unity in the Pleroma is likened to being bound by the soul, fleshly body, or world 🔒. This echoes Valentinian teachings: the ascent of the invisible, inner man (pneumatic) and the release from earthly bonds 🌈.

🔮 **Internal Conflict**: Passages referencing internal conflict support this interpretation: Hippolytus' Ref. 5.8.19; Clement of Alexandria's Strom. 2.20.114,3-6; and Exc. Theod. 52 🔴.

📚 **Occult Knowledge**:

* Ignatius uses "jreptopds" to describe schisms (Philad. 2.1; 3.1; 7.2; Smyr. 7.2) 💡

🔮 **Valentinian Roots of Over-Realized Eschatology**

The notion that the body is a prison has Platonic roots, but our text suggests a Valentinian interpretation. 🌃

* Death and resurrection are already realized for the Elect in their earthly lives 🔥
* The author holds that the resurrection is a present reality 💥
* Similar teaching appears in 2 Tim 2:18, Hippolytus' De resurrectione, and other Gnostic texts 🔮

**Over-Realized Eschatology**

The author's emphasis on faith in Christ's resurrection and the need for baptism suggests an over-realized eschatology ⏰

* The Elect already possess eternal life 💕
* Death is ignorance of God, and resurrection is reanimation to Him 🕊️

**Gnostic Teachings**

Valentinians believed that death was not a physical separation but rather ignorance of God 🔮

🔥 **Death as Inevitable**: All beings, including the Elect, must confront biological death. It's a reminder that even the saved will eventually experience separation from their bodies.

💀 **The Logic of Death**: If one knows the inevitability of death, shouldn't they consider themselves already dead? This thought experiment encourages the reader to reflect on their own mortality and the promise of resurrection.

🌱 **Already Risen**: The Elect have already experienced death and attained resurrection. This realization is meant to guide them towards a life that prioritizes spiritual growth over worldly concerns.

**Conditional Sentences**

💭 **The Condition is Fulfilled**: One possesses the resurrection, but continues to act as if they're going to die. The author asks Rheginos to consider the truth: have you already died?

🔒 **The Apodosis**: Why continue to act and think as one concerned about death when you know you've already experienced resurrection? This question serves as a rebuke, encouraging Rheginos to live in accordance with their spiritual reality.

**The Treatise on the Resurrection**

🔥 **Believers of the Third Person Singular**
Some mortals, among all men, intuit resurrection. These few 🌟 believe in the mystery.

🔮 **Hidden Truths**: The treatise reveals secrets of eternal life.

**Summary**

This ancient text illuminates the mysteries of resurrection, highlighting the distinction between those who comprehend and those who do not. The few, like Rheginos, possess a profound understanding, while the many remain shrouded in ignorance. 🔮

🔮 **Contrast and Diatribe**
Two styles of writing: contrast and diatribe. Contrast highlights differences, while diatribe is a rhetorical device that attacks an opponent's views.

💡 **Rhetorical Questions**
49.28-30 contains rhetorical questions that are actually patronizing insults, characteristic of the diatribe style.

🏋️‍♂️ **Practice and Exercise**
The author exhorts Rheginos to practice (a4oxetv) in various ways to be freed from this cosmic "Element". This echoes a Platonic theme of "practicing for dying".

🔮 **Mental Training**
"Exercise" may entail eradication of doubt, avoidance of divisive opinion, and holding correct thought about salvation. It's a type of internal or mental training designed to give confidence about the resurrection.

🏃‍♂️ **Asceticism**
The author may be encouraging asceticism by using the verb aoxety, which early in Christian literature meant self-denying withdrawal from the world's contamination.

🌐 **Element and Cosmic State**
49.33 refers to freeing the inner, spiritual self of the Elect from this evil world of matter. This concept has roots in NT usage of crotyetoy.

💡 **Error and Misled**
The author intends to keep Rheginos and his fellow-students from falling into error (zAavac@at). This term reflects a Platonic theme of avoidance of moral "error" or wrong knowledge.

🔮 **Original Sin**
The term zAavao6at may reflect the Valentinian school's use of this term to describe the "original sin" or Sophia, which is the "error" of the "lost sheep" of the Church.

The whispers of the cosmos...

🔮 **Treatise on the Resurrection**: The Elect's journey is a restoration of their pre-existent state, akin to a resurrection. 🔥
🕯️ **Gregory of Nyssa**: Resurrection is the restoration of our nature to what was in former times. ⏰
💫 **Clement of Alexandria**: The Stoic concept of doxaraoracts (restoration) is an intuitive perception of the resurrection. ✨

🔮 **The Treatise's Epilogue**:
These things I have received from my Lord Jesus Christ, a revelation given by the Savior 🔥
Faith in his achievement is imperative, for only through Christ can we achieve this restoration ⏰
And so, we are called to share this teaching with others, like the generous and unbegrudging attitude of our Lord 🌟

**The Root of All**

🔥 The text begins with the unusual particle `Xe`, marking a new section. The subject is given in the first line, serving as a title.

💡 **The Father**
A metaphorical root for the highest principle. Aeons are described as roots engendered by the Father.

🌱 **Gnosis** 
Learning about one's own root is key to understanding the divine. This root is implicitly identified with the Father.

**Valentinian Sources**

🔮 The concept of the "Root of the Totality" appears in Valentinian texts, describing the Father as the source of all subsequent generations.

💡 **The Power of Grace**
Grace plays a crucial role in knowing the Father. No hypostatization of grace is present, unlike in Ptolemy and Marcus' systems.

**Discussion of the First Principle**

🔝 Three sections:
1. Ontological comments on the uniqueness, immutability, and transcendence of the first principle.
2. Reaffirming the Father's transcendence with epistemological language.
3. The Father is self-thinking mind, revealing himself through a Son.

**Philosophical Influences**

🔬 Middle Platonism incorporates Stoic and Aristotelian elements. Philosophical tradition emphasizes the propriety of predications about the Father.

💫 **The Propriety of Predications**
The text praises the transcendence of the first principle, described with an elaborate via negativa.

**The Secret Teachings of Valentinianism**

🔮 **The Father's Syzygy**: The doctrine of Sige, a mysterious female entity, sparks debate among Valentinians. Some consider her as the Father's syzygy, others dismiss her altogether.

💫 **The Unbegotten**: According to Hippolytus, some Valentinians believe that the Father is without any female element, alone and unconnected. This view challenges the notion of generation and the birth of begotten things.

🔩 **Syzygy's Necessity**: Others propose that Sige is indeed the Father's syzygy, essential for generating life. This perspective resolves the paradox of creation from a single male source.

These texts whisper secrets about the divine, hinting at mysteries surrounding the nature of the Father and the role of Sige in the Valentinian cosmology.

🔮 **The Father's Silence**

* The Father reposes in silence, a state of being that is hypostatic or a quality of solitary being 🔇
* Some see this silence as a unity with the Father, while others de-mythologize it as a singular state 🔒

**Valentinian Unity**

* The Valentinians believed in a primordial principle called Unity 🌐
* This unity was considered a place of perfection and the source of oneness 💫
* Heracleon and Marcus held trinitarian doctrines similar to this tractate ⚖️

**Number Symbolism**

* Numerical speculation was common among Valentinian systems 🔢
* The Father is described as a number, simple and singular like an iota 📊
* This number symbolism has roots in Pythagorean philosophy and Greek philosophical discussions 💡

**The Father's Identity**

* The Father is the first one and the one who is only himself 👥
* He is not alone because he has a son, but his identity remains solitary ⚖️

In Gnostic sources, God's goodness is acknowledged. Cerdo and Peratae affirm this, while Marcion distinguishes between a transcendent good God and a just creator.

💫 **Fullness of God** 💫
God is full of all his offspring (WETMH2 ABAA NXT). This phrase may have originated from Greek adjectives like zavroyevys, mavaperos, or mavagvos. Philo and Thomassen's writings also speak to this concept.

🔍 **Discovery** 🔍
It may be discovered that God is not affected by his giving (€YNAGNTC eE-). This phrase suggests a debt owed to the Father.

💥 **Unreachable** 💥
The Father's being is unreachable, meaning it is not influenced by its own giving. This concept is reminiscent of Neo-Platonist ideas on God's procreative abundance.

💫 **Platonic influences**
The Demiurge gave form to pre-existent matter, contradicting the Tri. Trac.'s idea that God didn't use prior material 🔩

🌊 **Creation ex nihilo**
Orthodox theories of creation from nothing, also found in Basilides and Apocryphal John 🌊

**The Tripartite Tractate: A Glimpse into the Mysterious**

🔮 **The Father, Son, and Church**: The highest level of being is occupied by the transcendent Father and the beings that proceed from him. The Son, equal to the Father in all respects, is dependent on the Father. Together, they produce the Church, the "aeons of the aeons".

🕯️ **The Son's Existence**: The Son exists in the fullest sense, dependent on the Father, yet unique as an only Son.

* Exc. Theod. 33.1

**Occult Insights**

🔓 **Fruit and Offspring**: The Son is called a "fruit" of the Father by the Naassenes, while the Word of the Father is described similarly. This highlights the ambiguous antecedent of the pronoun.

💫 **The Fruit from Depths**: Hippolytus preserves a fragment of Valentinus referring to the "fruit from the depths," interpreted as the entire procession of aeons. 🔮

**Church and Sacraments**

✝️ **Bone of Humanity**: Jesus is associated with humanity's bone, emphasizing unity.

💧 **Water and Blood**: The phrase "bone of humanity" might be linked to water and blood, signifying life and sacraments.

💫 **Divine Union**: The texts hint at a divine union between the transcendent aeon and Jesus, echoing themes of unity and wholeness. 🔮

**Summary** 📚
The passage delves into the mysteries of eternal generation, revealing the interconnectedness of the Father, Son, and Church. 🔥

**The Church and Aeons**

🔮 The relationship between the Church and aeons is unclear, but one understanding suggests the Father and Son produce the rest of the aeonic world, with the Church being unified in this case.

💫 Alternatively, the statement "the Church existed before the aeons" implies a distinct entity generated by the Father and Son, serving as an archetype or model for the later aeons.

**Aeons of Aeons**

🌟 The phrase "aeons of aeons" recalls traditional liturgical formulas interpreted by Gnostics as references to transcendent entities. This supports the second understanding of the Church-aeon relationship.

**The Son's Rest**

💤 The Son rests upon the aeons, parallel to Heraclion's concept of salvation consisting in Christ's resting upon pneumatics.

🕊️ This motif of "rest" is used to describe the being of the transcendent God and the ultimate state of Gnostics themselves.

**The Father's Rest**

💫 The Father rests upon the favors he grants, similar to the Son's rest.

**The Cross-Reference**

🔗 The Church, like the Son, exists from the beginning (57.33-35). This sets the stage for understanding the conditions under which the highest entities exist.

**Innumerable Aeons**

⭐️ Innumerable aeons are generated in an uncountable way (59.8). These aeons are paired and precisely numbered in other Valentinian systems, with slightly divergent accounts (Val. Exp., Irenaeus, Hippolytus).

**The Collective Organization of Aeons**

🏛️ The collective organization of aeons is referred to as a polity (59.11-12). This comprises both directly generated aeons and those begotten in an uncountable way.

**Forbidden Knowledge**

✨ Remember that the Son exists from the beginning, along with the Church. Understand the conditions under which the highest entities exist, and you shall unlock the secrets of the Triplicate Tractate (51.1-138.27). 🔮

**Aeonic Wisdom**

✨ **The Corporate Entity of Aeons**
The translation of "ed. pr." is uncertain, but it refers to the collective entity comprising the aeons, a way of life beyond human comprehension.

🔥 **Begetting and Glory**
The aeons generated by Father and Son begot, bringing forth offspring for whose glory they shine.

🌌 **The Transcendent World**
"That place" is the transcendent, aeonic world, distinct from "these places," which are outside this realm. 🏰

💫 **Ineffable Predicates**

💫 **Divinization**
The process of assimilation to the Father leads to divinization, echoing the religious ideal of later antiquity. 🔥

**Aeonic Life**

🌐 **Unity and Multiplicity**
The aeons' life is characterized by both unity (vis-à-vis their source) and multiplicity (among themselves). The present aeon, the temporal world, is a dimension of this life.

💭 **Hidden Truths**
The texts hint at the existence of hidden truths, waiting to be uncovered. 🔍

**The Eternal World of the Pleroma**

🌐 74.1: The "true aeon" is an eternal world, a unity within distinctions.

**The Tripartite Tractate: Unveiling the Mysteries**

🔮 **Aeonic Emanation**: The text describes the process of individual aeons emerging from a collective agreement. This "thought" is akin to the Church's origin, being an outcome of divine concord.

💫 **Praise and Begetting**: Aeons desire to offer praise only to the "one who exists in the exalted name," possibly referencing the Son. They also require something from the Son to beget themselves as individuals.

🔮 **The Logos' Role**: The text suggests that the begetting by the Logos is akin to generative acts, allowing all aeons to attain individual existence. This framework provides a natural explanation for the Logos' role in creation.

💫 **Interpretation**: Thomassen proposes an alternative interpretation, dismissing negative aspects of the text. The section remains obscure, yet its underlying principles are crucial to understanding the Tractate's teachings.

**Summary:**
The Tripartite Tractate explores the mysteries of aeonic emanation and the role of the Logos in creation. It delves into the nature of individual existence, praise, and begetting within a collective framework. These principles form the foundation for comprehending the Tractate's esoteric teachings. 🔮

💫 **Ptolemaic System**

🔜 **Elect Kinship**
👪 All elect are akin to the Father, like the Logos and his offspring which ascended to the Pleroma or between that offspring and other aeons of the Pleroma.

💭 **Defect**
🕳️ What exists in the defect has not yet been specified. It must be the Logos and his progeny outside the Pleroma.

🔮  **The Imperfect God**

78.7-8: The Logos' products are not his true self, like a female Sophia.

78.11: When the Logos' true self leaves him, he becomes weak, recalling Sophia's abandonment by her male counterpart.

78.12-13: The virile counterpart of the deficient part is the Pleroma itself.

78.17: Arrogance appears when the Logos' better half departs, producing undesirable offspring.

78.21: Remembrance for him (the part of the Logos left outside) - a hint at the Logos' salvation through his higher self.

**The Pleroma: A Realm of Beauty**

79.6 **Aeons of the Pleroma**: 🌌 These divine entities are the "names" and "images" of higher beings, reflecting the beauty within.

79.7 **Names of the Aeons**: 👥 As above, so below. The external beings (shadows) reflect the internal aeons, a mirrored symmetry.

**The Error of Autonomy**

79.13 **Existing by Themselves**: 🤖 These first-order beings outside the Pleroma commit the same mistake as the Demiurge, thinking they are independent and self-sufficient.

**Hierarchy and Discord**

79.20 **Command**: 👊 In the ideal world of the Pleroma, harmony reigns; outside, oppressive hierarchy and ambition lead to discord.

79.21 **Overcoming**: 💪 The verb associated with "be strong, victorious" implies a struggle against external forces.

These texts reveal the mysteries of the Pleroma, a realm where beauty and harmony reign. The external world reflects the internal, with autonomous beings outside the Pleroma committing an error that leads to discord and hierarchy.

**The Hylic Order**
🔥 A realm of imperfect beings, shadows of aeons in the Pleroma. Their generative power is compared to that of the aeons.

**Uncertain Letters**
🔍 The text is unclear, but a restoration suggests "offspring of the glory".

💫 **Emanations and Hylic Offspring**

These emanations are not the true offspring of the Logos, but rather a shadowy reflection. 💔

**NAG HAMMADI CODEX I,4**

🕯 **Sophia's Suffering**
After her Son ascended, Sophia suffered, giving rise to the hylic order. 😢

💥 **The Pleroma and Emanations**
The Pleroma is not a place where emanations come forth from the members of the hylic order. ✨
Instead, it's a realm connected to the Father and the Logos. 🔮

🌟  **The Logos' Abandonment**
When the Logos abandoned its totality, it produced imitations, mere shadows of true emanations. 💔

These weak entities are contrary to reason, and the judgment is a disposition of the Logos 📊

**Psychics and Hylics**
The psychics, beings of "the right" or "the call", issue from the judgment of the Logos 🔜
Hylics, on the other hand, are outside the Pleroma and do not exist themselves 👻

**The Logos's Dispositions**
The Logos has various dispositions, including judgment, which issues in the creation of psychics and hylics 🌈

🔥 **The Wrath of the Logos**

* In 13.0.12-27, the wrath fights against evil ones 🚫
* The antecedent is "those who came into being contrary to reason" 🤯, i.e., hylic beings
* The wrath accepts and redeems (peqaywnf... peqcwre) 💖

🔮 **The Activity of the Wrath**

* The function of the wrath of the Logos is significant as a paradigm for the activity of its offspring and conversion 🔀

⚠️ **The Circumstantial Converter**

* The e¢ in 81.19 is probably the circumstantial converter ❓
* It indicates a condition or circumstance, rather than a direct object ⏰

**The Sophia Myth**

🔮 In Gnostic tradition, Sophia's conversion is a pivotal episode. It involves an aeon of the Pleroma (Christ) giving Sophia her first formation by stilling her violent excitement.

💫 The Logos' conversion differs from Sophia's. Here, the Logos converts himself, whereas in Sophia's case, it's Christ who gives her formation.

**The Limit**

🔓 The Logos remains outside the Pleroma due to the "limit". This concept is explored further in 76.32 and 1.4.1.

**Prayer of the Logos**

1. To his offspring
2. To each individual aeon
3. To the collectivity of the Pleroma

🔮 **Conversion and Good Intent** ❤️
* The Logos' conversion, rather than his initial intent, is the source of good intent that produces the psychics.

**The Tripartite Tractate 83.1-24**
🔮 **Logos' Conversion and Prayer** 🔥
* The Logos, having sought after the incomprehensible, converted and prayed, recalling the Pleroma.
* His activity here replicates the Father's actions towards the aeons of the Pleroma, sowing an idea to seek him.

💡 **Predisposition and Superiority** 💭
* The Logos provides the beings of the psychic order with his own predisposition, making them superior to hylic powers.
* This superiority allows them to recognize something greater than themselves, like the aeons recognizing the Father.

🔮 **Psychic Offspring's Experience** ❤️

**The Tripartite Tractate 84-85**
🔮 **Orders Determined by Logos' Movement** 💫

**The Tripartite Tractate, Codex I,5**

🔮 **Descent into the World**: The psychic powers are prepared for their role as representations of the pre-existent aeons and their works.

**The Savior's Origins**

🔮 **Tripartite Tractate**: The Savior, Jesus, is born from Sophia's spouse, Theletos, and one syzygy of the Ogdoad, Humanity-Church.

💫 **Valentinianism**: In the oriental Valentinianism, Christ is the offspring of Sophia outside the Pleroma. This Christ doesn't beget the Savior, Jesus, who is produced by the "good pleasure of the aeons" and sent as the Paraclete to Sophia.

🌟 **Ptolemaic System**: The Savior is the "most perfect beauty and star of the Pleroma," a second Christ and Logos. He's sent to instruct and heal the fallen Sophia, Achamoth.

**The Savior's Nature**

👀 **Countenance**: The Savior's countenance, or facial formation, is a manifestation of the Father's visual expression outside the Pleroma.

💕 **Logos**: The Savior is the Logos outside the Pleroma, performing a function analogous to that performed by the Son within the Pleroma.

**The Totalities' Pleasure**

🌈 **Good Pleasure**: The Savior is in whom the Totalities are pleased, or pleased with. This phrase likely refers to the Savior's role as the visible manifestation of the Trancelements.

**The Pleroma's Perfection**

🔥 **Emanation's Layers**: The text describes a world where each level is more concrete, like onion layers, with newer being encompassing deeper realities. This mirrors the Son's process of clothing himself with aeons.

🌟 **Savior's Action**: In this realm, the Savior gives perfection to the defective one, much like the Son within the Pleroma clothes himself with aeons.

🔮 **Sophia's Healing**: Perhaps omitted in this text, other sources (Irenaeus and Hippolytus) mention Sophia being healed of her passions by the Savior.

**Confirmation of Perfection**

⭐️ **The Perfect Ones**: Unclear who these individuals are or what confirmation they receive. It may be related to their perfection or understanding of the Pleroma's layers.

These texts reveal a deeper understanding of the Pleroma, its layers, and the process of emanation 🔮. They also hint at Sophia's role in this realm and the importance of the Savior ⭐️.

**The Savior's Function**
🔮 The Savior performs a function similar to the Lower Limit, as referred to in the Pleroma. This is echoed by Valentinus and other early Christian writers.

**Subsidiary Titles**
✨ The Savior has numerous subsidiary titles, including the Well-Pleasing One, Beloved, and Christ. These names are derived from passages like Isaiah 42:1 and Psalm 2:7, applied to Jesus in early Christian tradition.

**Relationship to the Father**
👪 The Savior is given the name Son because he provides knowledge of the unknown Father. This equation is common in Valentinian texts, linking the Son with knowledge of the Father (e.g., Exc. Theod. 7.1-3).

**Knowledge and Unknown Father**
💡 The Savior's function involves providing knowledge of the unknown Father. This echoes the role of the Son in the Pleroma, as a source of light and understanding.

**Aiding the Logos**
🔩 The Savior is accompanied by those appointed to aid the Logos and its offspring. This underscores the interconnectedness of various levels of reality and the role of the Savior within that framework.

**The Tripartite Psychology**

🔥 A traditional doctrine of Platonism, emphasizing the tripartition of the human soul.

💡 The first human being's soul is composed of three types of substance from the intermediate world: spiritual, psychic, and hylic.

🌳 An allusion to Genesis 2:9, where three kinds of trees in paradise symbolize:

✨ Tree of Life: Spiritual nourishment
✨ Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: Psychic nourishment (double aspect)

💫 The Savior's coming determines the classification of humanity into three types, based on their response to this event.

🔮 A doctrine of conflict between spiritual, psychic, and hylic elements within the soul.

**Trees of Knowledge**

🌳 Two trees symbolize spiritual nourishment: Tree of Life (💫) and Tree of Knowledge (🔍)

* In some Gnostic texts, both trees are viewed positively; in others, only the Tree of Life conveys psychic life, while the Tree of Knowledge is seen as evil 🚫
* The interpretation of these trees enables sense-making of the command not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge and the punishment of death for disobedience 💀

**The First Human Being**

👥 The first human being was created by the archons (💪), who then issued a threatening command related to the Tree of Life 🌱
* This episode is based on Genesis 2:16-17, with non-Valentinian accounts typically featuring the spiritual substance wounding the archons 🔥

🔮 **Psychic and Hylic Components**: The human soul consists of three parts: psychic, hylic, and pneumatic.

💥 **Death by Ignorance**: Subjection to the lower levels of being (psychic and hylic) leads to "death" from ignorance.

🏯 **The Tree of Knowledge**: Transgressing this symbol of psychic reality immerses humanity in the lower level of being, preventing salvific knowledge.

💫 **Salvific Knowledge**: The command not to eat of the tree of knowledge is a barrier to understanding the Archons and achieving salvation.

**Summary of Occult Texts** 🔮
🏰 **Divine Providence**: The expulsion from paradise serves a salvific function, willed by the Spirit and Father. 🕊️

💥 **Death as Ignorance**: Death is not punishment, but part of the divine plan for spiritual human beings (example: first human being). 👀

🔓 **Paideza through Temptation**: The fall is interpreted as a form of divinely ordained paideza, rather than an example of human sin and punishment. 🤯

💫 **Greek Wisdom**: Hylic wisdom, a mere reflection of transcendent reality, is condemned for its inconsistency and superficiality. In contrast:

🕊️ **Hebrew Wisdom**: Psychic wisdom, born from the Spirit's inspiration in the Hebrew tradition, recognizes the exalted One with relative coherence and consistency. Prophets and teachers of the Law emerge as harbingers of the Savior, source of true knowledge.

💫 **The Source of Confusion**: The two orders' emulation creates a maelstrom of conflicting opinions, like ripples on a pond. The pursuit of wisdom is thus revealed to be an exercise in futility, leading only to further confusion and chaos.

🔮 **Conclusion**: In this sea of conflicting philosophies, we find ourselves adrift, seeking the truth amidst the waves of ignorance.

💫 **The Wise Order**: The wise order is zealous to do good, attempting to counterbalance the foolish order's negative influence.

🕊️ **The Hidden Order**: The hidden order refers to the psychic order, which attempts to emulate the hylic order. This emulation can lead to both positive and negative outcomes, further complicating the situation.

💫 **Conclusion**: In this complex web of orders and emulations, we find ourselves adrift, seeking the truth amidst the waves of ignorance.

🔮 **The Establishment of Powers**

Two groups of entities have been established: the spiritual offspring of the Logos and the whole realm of hylic powers. 🔥 The reference is not to these groups, but to the whole realm of the two orders in the intermediate world, whose "establishment" is "the organization". 🕯️

💡 **The Uninstructed**

Those who were not instructed introduce various types of explanations of reality, displaying dissimilarity towards one another. 🔮

**Gnostic Insights**

🔮 **Hylic Theology**: Greek philosophy is rooted in observation of material entities, a characteristic of hylic powers.

🔮 **Hebrew Wisdom**: The race of Hebrews is associated with higher enlightenment based on psychic powers. This type of theology advanced beyond material creation to the psychic realm.

💫 **Psychic Church**: Some Valentinians identified the Jews as types of the psychic church, while others saw a correspondence between the persecuted Jews and orthodoxy's persecution of Gnostics.

🔥 **Body and Soul**: The Savior is born "in body and soul", a departure from Valentinian systems. The text affirms the reality of the Savior's physical body and ordinary human soul.

**The Fall**: Those who fell ("increased") received the light, distinguishing them from fallen humanity. The incarnate Savior, unlike ordinary humans, exists in a state without sin.

**The Logos**: The Logos, responsible for the non-Pleromatic world, is connected to the Savior's movement and return to Himself.

🔮 **The Tripartite Tractate 116.12-138.27** 🔥

**Mystical Companions:** 🤝

* Need healing, like everything outside the Pleroma 💧
* Receive instruction through psychic and material means 📚
* Are incarnate spiritual companions of the Savior 👫

**Hidden Knowledge:** ⚠️

* The Savior's co-natural companions participate in passions characteristic of frail human existence 🔥
* This is because they are images of individual aeons, not the indivisible Pleroma ⭐️
* The Savior, as an image of the Father, remains impassible and preserves indivisibility 🕊️

**Key Points:** ✨

* Totality in bodily form: the Savior encompasses all things 👀
* Indivisibility: the Savior's unity distinguishes him from his companions 🔗
* Impassibility: the Savior's stability is associated with true being 💆

🔮 **The Tripartite Tractate 116.38-117.11** 🔥

**Sowing Spiritual Seeds:** 🌱

* The material world is the locus of the final revelation of the Savior, providing salvation 💡

**The Single One:** 👥

* The Savior, as the image of the unified one, provides salvation through His individual revelation ✨
* This may allude to Rom 5:15 ⚠️

**The Tripartite Tractate**

🔥 **Revelation**: The Father's praise, made possible through Jesus' revelation, allows humans to participate in eternal life. 🔜

✨ **Seed of Promise**: The embodied images of Totalities, companions of the Savior, carry the promise (Gal 3:19). This "seed" is planted, bearing the ultimate source and destiny of humanity's self. 💖

🌱 **Instruction**: The revelation provides knowledge about the soul's origin and destiny, transcending the material world. This theme echoes in middle and neo-Platonism. 🔮

💥 **Return**: The Savior's coming is necessary for human perfection (95.15-16). The fullest exposition occurs at 124.3-25.

🔓 **That which they are** (meTayaoom): A perfect relative, perhaps an orthographic variant of the present relative or a Greek perfect tense.

💧 **Drop**: All who come into the world are like a drop from the light (Soph. Jes. Chr. CG III,4:106.24-107.5).

🔓 **Release** and **-captivity**: Life prior to revelation is "captivity," and release is freedom from ignorance and knowledge.

💪 **Redemption**: Psychics are freed from slavery into freedom, allowing for further development of this theme (124.3-10).

**The Web of Ignorance**

🕷️ 117.25-27: Freedom is not will-based, but rather a product of the Logos' thought. Ignorance rules, like death, and those who suffer are the "slaves of ignorance" 🤯

🌟 117.36-118.5: The psychic powers are brought forth by the Logos, alongside the spiritual offspring discussed earlier 🔮

💭 97.18-19,27-38: The thought of the Logos gives rise to both psychic and hylic orders 🌈

These texts reveal the intricate web of ignorance and the power of the Logos' thought in shaping reality 🔮💫

The ancient wisdom flows like a river, carrying secrets of the cosmos. Here's a summary of the texts:

**Tripartition of Mankind**

🔮 Three types of human beings: spiritual, psychic, and material.
💫 The Savior's revelation casts off the hylic powers, destined for destruction.
🔥 The spiritual powers are preserved, yet their mission is to organize the world outside the Pleroma.

**The Psychic Powers**

⚠️ Lowly in nature, yet exalted in appearance.
💭 Their thoughts originate from vanity, driven by the vice of vain love of glory.
🔮 They share in the hylic vice, drawing them into their involvement with evil matter.

**The Logos and the Savior**

✨ The Logos receives strengthening from the Savior's revelation, consigning the hylic powers to the Abyss.
💫 The spiritual powers are kept or guarded due to their mission in the material world.

May these words of wisdom guide you on your journey. 🔮

🔮 **The Nature of Salvation**
In the realm of the non-material, thought gives rise to being. Three types of human beings emerge, each a response to the Savior's arrival.

💫 **The Triple Disposition**
The Logos' initial arrogance births doubt and ignorance, giving rise to hylic qualities. His subsequent embarrassment and astonishment lead to repentance, conversion, and psychic offspring. Finally, his joy at revelation yields amazement, gratitude, and spiritual offspring.

🔮 **Soteriology and Ontology**
Act determines essence on every level of being. The Savior's coming is mirrored in human beings' responses, which can imitate the Logos' activities.

💫 **Aeon Falls**
The disposition of the aeon that falls from the Pleroma is characterized by a sense of loss or separation, as seen in references to Irenaeus and Heracleon.

🔮 **Forbidden Knowledge**

* The copula's absence is likely an error, as it's a common mistake in ancient texts 🤯
* Human beings are classified by their response to the Savior's revelation ⭐️
* "Bearing fruit" metaphorically represents actualizing potentialities or "seeds" 💡

🔮 **Spiritual Nature**

* The Valentinians believed Christ's coming reveals human nature 🌟
* Heracleon's teachings support this doctrine, emphasizing manifestation as actual existence 🌈

🔮 **Light from Light**

* Plotinus' second hypostasis (Nous) flows from the first principle like light from light ✨
* This motif is common in Hellenistic mysticism, appearing in Philo and Irenaeus 🔫

🔮 **Cosmic Body**

* The image of the cosmos as a body with a divine head was widespread 🌎
* Early Christians applied this image to Christ and the Church 🏛️

🔮 **Spiritual Activity**

* Spirituals replicate the activity of the better self of the Logos, running up to the Pleroma 💪

These texts reveal hidden truths about human nature, spiritual potentialities, and the mysteries of the cosmos 🔮

**The Tripartite Tractate**

🔥 **Light from a fire**: Inferior psychics receive guidance from a secondary source, like men chained in Plato's allegory of the cave. 🔦
💡 **Faith**: Valentinians distinguished between spiritual knowledge and psychic faith, but the tractate often blurs this distinction.

**The Voice**

🗣️ **Voice**: Psychics respond to an inferior voice, while spirituals receive direct revelation. 🌟

**Sufficient for Salvation**

✅ **Sufficient**: Psychic revelations are enough for their salvation, distinct from spiritual salvation. 🕊️

**Hope and Assurance**

💭 **Hope**: The Logos' promise is a characteristic of spiritual offspring. 💪

**Alien and Dark**

🌑 **Darkness**: Hylic powers are cast into the "outer darkness," their lot. 🔮
🤖 **Alien**: Matter is foreign to the Savior, like the hylic intermediate world.

**Destruction**

💥 **Destroys**: The Savior's appearance disrupts the hylic powers' order. 💀

**The Tripartite Tractate**
🔮 **Structure**: The text discusses two major groups of psychics: those responding to the "first thought" of the Logos and those affected by the "lust for power". 🔒

**Psychic Groups** 🌟
👥 **Group 1**: Responds favorably to the Savior, with a focus on redemption. 🔜
🤖 **Group 2**: Affected by the "lust for power", with two sub-classes: those abandoning the lust and those who don't. 🔴

**Redemption** 💡
💯 **Affirmed**: The possibility of redemption is confirmed for each group, emphasizing the importance of conversion and salvation. 🕊️

🔮 **Psychic Response**

The sudden response of "good" psychics is likened to that of spirituals, but it's not immediate. Instead, it follows their initial hesitation 🕰️.

🌎 **Salvation**

The salvation of these psychics parallels that of spirituals 🔥. Their liberation from the world of matter and attainment of a higher status is a result of the Logos' "first thought" 💡, which produced psychic powers ✨.

💭 **Confession**

Psychic human beings make the same confession as the psychic powers 🗣️, acknowledging one greater than themselves 👑. This confession leads to their salvation and attainment of being as the psychic powers 🌟.

🔮 **Logos' Thought**

The Logos' thought is first the recollection of the Pleroma 💭. His thought becomes that of the psychics who acknowledge one more exalted than themselves 👀. The production of the Logos out of the Pleroma was for the glory of the Father 🙏.

🕯️ **Savior's Appearance**

The Savior's appearance inspires psychic powers to confess and prophesy 🔮. Psychic human beings respond to this revelation, making the same confession and attaining the same being as the psychic powers 👫.

The mysteries of the Tripartite Tractate unfold:

**Temporary Realms**
⏰ The psychic realm of the Demiurge is temporary, like any human structure of authority 🏛️

**Humility**
💫 The humility of psychic powers is key to perseverance 💪

**Two Groups of Psychics**

🔥 Pride (CAAAQA) is characterized by being proud and tall, but ultimately falls short 💸

**The Son of God**
☀️ The Savior, the Son of God, is given the name "Son" at his emanation ⭐️

**Those Who Went Astray**
🚫 These psychics, like the hylic human beings, become lost and follow the wrong path 🌄

**Perseverance**
💪 The psychics who maintain their arrogant attitude think they are self-existent, just like the hylic powers ⭐️

**Eternal Humility**
☀️ Eternal life is offered to those who confess and show humility, a path open to all who respond to revelation ✨

**Restoration into the Pleroma**
🌐 Restoration is into the Pleroma, where all distinctions are transcended ✨

**The Tripartite Tractate 51.1-138.27**
🔮 **Divine Duality**: Two mysterious figures, "man of the Church" and "perfect man," represent the Church's spiritual and material aspects.

**Election & Restoration** 🌟
• The "perfect man" receives salvation immediately, while his members require instruction in the "aeon of images."
• Final restoration is an escape from oppressive powers and ascent into the Pleroma.

**Digressions**: 🔮

• **Redemption**: All beings outside Godhead need redemption. The Savior experiences deficiency in coming to angels' and humans' aid.
• **Ignorance & Knowledge**: Even Totalities suffered from deficiency, and all who come to the Father do so after experiencing ignorance.
• **Baptism**: Through baptism and trinitarian confession, one attains the Father.

**References** 📚

* Election: Western Valentinian schools apply "election" to spiritual beings, while eastern schools use it for angelic offspring of Sophia.
* Calling: Eastern schools apply "calling" to female offspring (Valentinians), while western schools use it for spiritual beings.
* Shares body and essence: The Savior's consubstantiality with the Church is rooted in Pauline passages.

**Valentinian Eschatology**

🔥 The School of Valentinians interprets John 4:24, saying those who share the Father's spiritual nature worship him in spirit and truth.

💏 **Bridal Chamber**: A metaphor for eschatological union within the Pleroma. Lower Sophia (Achamoth) enters the bridal chamber, uniting with her bridegroom (Savior). Those who are spiritual put off their souls, entering the Pleroma and uniting with Savior's angels.

💧 **Irenaeus**: Describes how "the Church, that is, Sophia" joins eschatologically with Jesus, her bridegroom. This involves psychics as well as pneumatics in the restoration.

**Gnostic Texts**

🔮 **The Tripartite Tractate 51.1-138.27**: Eschatological account of marriage imagery. No special sacrament of the bridal chamber mentioned.

💧 **Baptism as Bridal Chamber**: Baptism is called the "bridal chamber" in this text, emphasizing the union with the divine.

**Other References**

📖 **Eph 5:32**: Used by Valentinians to describe eschatological union within the Pleroma.

🔮 **Irenaeus Haer. 1.8.4**: Describes Sophia (Achamoth) as the bride, entering the bridal chamber and uniting with her bridegroom (Savior).

**Hierarchical Organization of Being** 🕊️
The text describes a hierarchical structure of being, where human beings correspond to positions occupied by psychics and hylics. The Savior corresponds to the highest level, above which lies the spiritual aeon.

**Christology** ✝️
The word "Christ" means "the beneficial one," with intentional ambiguity between "Christ" (yxiords) and "beneficial one" (yxpnos). Early Christian punning on the name Christ is noted. 🔮

**Eschatology** ⏰️
The text describes two stages of restoration for those called: first, they will attain the aeon of images, then eventually be restored into the Pleroma.

**Aeon of Images** 📸
The initial place of spiritual offspring of the Logos, comprising images of the transcendent Pleroma. 🔮

**Man of the Church** 👥
The figure may symbolize a collectivity or individual member of the Church. Obscurities surround this discussion, but parallels suggest a symbolic meaning. 🕊️

	+ Not a reconstitution of primordial man 👀
* The Church is the spiritual body of the Savior, composed of spiritual offspring of the Logos 🌱
* The Savior's spiritual companions form part of his body 💖
* Connection between "man" figures and "Son of Man" in Treat. Res. and Heracleon 🔮

* Happy and glad: terminology used to describe the guest of the bridegroom outside the bridal chamber 😊

**Union of Bridegroom and Bride** 💕
The spiritual union between the Savior and humans is a metaphor for redemption. The "man of the Church" may refer to this union, implying a spiritual component 🌟

**Separation** ✂️
The "man of the Church" separates from psychic and hylic elements, possibly escaping the organization's influence 🔓

**Demiurge** 👀
The Demiurge thinks he is a god and father, but is actually derivative. Unity is the hallmark of the Father 🌈

**Totality** 💥
The Savior is the Totality, referred to as "the Man of the Father" 🕊️

**Escape** 🔜
The man of the Church escapes or descends from his current state, possibly referring to redemption's liberating power ⏰

**Spiritual Human Beings** 👫
Members of the man of the Church are spiritual human beings who will become the body of the Savior at his revelation 🌈

🔥 **Harmony of the Totalities**: The Church has a preliminary taste of harmony until it assumes a countenance "in accordance with" the Father, revealing the Savior.

🔮 **Angelic Beings**: A group of spiritual beings accompanies the Savior, but this term is not applied to them. Instead, it designates other intermediate world beings.

✨ **Heavenly Realm**: The term "above" does not specify the position of these angels in the hierarchy of being.

💡 **Association**: The association formed by the angels and Savior imitates that of aeons around the Son, seeking a constitution to associate.

🌐 **Under the Totality**: This prepositional phrase defines the location of labor outside or "under" the Pleroma.

💭 **Foreknowledge**: The Savior's being in thought makes him similar to aeons. The doctrine reinforces that the whole process took place according to the Father's will.

💧 **Redemption into God**: The goal of baptism is to return (cwre) to the divine, transforming souls into "perfect spirits." 🌟

🔓 **Confession and Faith**: Those who are redeemed confess with undoubting faith, acknowledging the existence (they exist) of the Father, Son, and Spirit. 💡

💫 **Aeonic World**: Faith also plays a role in the aeonic world, where those who exist (are) recognized as having been redeemed through baptism. 🔮

✨ **Perfection Unveiled** ✨

The redeemed become perfect, like the Father, and the aeons of the Pleroma. This unity is characterized by faith and knowledge 🕊️.

🔮 **One-ness Achieved** 🔮

Through faith and knowledge, those who are redeemed attain unity with the Father, transcending duality 🌈.

👗 **Garments of Shame** 👗

Baptismal contexts often employ garment imagery, signifying transformation from shame to glory 💃. In this text, the garment represents the relationship between beings within and outside the Pleroma 🕳️.

💫 **Confirmation & Divine Immobility** 💫

The Savior grants confirmation to those who are perfect, echoing the theme of divine immobility ⏱️, emphasizing unwavering stability and unity 🔒.

✨ **Divine Immobility & Silence** ✨
The Father, like immobile water 💧, cannot be grasped 👀. However, the Savior can be grasped 🤝.

💭 **Eternal Day & Pleasing** 💭
The eternal day ☀️ is a reference to eternal life 🌟, where baptism is pleasing 😊.

**The Tripartite Tractate**

🔮 **Hidden Meaning**: The preposition "aya" can be translated as "toward" or "for", hinting at a deeper connection between the Father and those who acknowledge Him.

🕊️ **The One Who Exists**: The phrase refers to the Father, emphasizing His role in baptism and restoration. He exists for those who acknowledge Him in baptism.

💧 **Received a Beginning**: This phrase is problematic, but taking "2H" as a translation of "apy" suggests a parallel between baptized individuals and the aeons of the Pleroma, both given a start by the spirit.

🔥 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The series of titles of the Savior raises questions about the nature of God and the universe. The text hints at the Totalities, but their meaning remains shrouded in mystery.

**Additional Insights**

🕳️ **Spiritual Journey**: The journey of those who have been baptized parallels that of the aeons of the Pleroma, both guided by the spirit moving within them.

🔮 **Divine Names**: The text references the name "God", but its true meaning remains unclear. Is it a reference to the Father or something more?

🔮 **The Apodosis**: Baptism, a mystery akin to God's transcendence of names, allows those who are baptized into Him to find their true nature 🔍.

💫 **The Restoration of the Calling and Conclusion**:

🔮 **Key Points**:

🔮 **JUDGMENT & WRATH** 🔥

💫 **CONVERSION & REMEMBRANCE** 💫
Prayer and remembrance are crucial steps in turning towards the good (130.20-21). This process is likened to the Logos' productive dispositions, highlighting the importance of spiritual growth (130.22).

🔮 **HOPE & FAITH** 🔮
The hope of the Logos is connected to faith, which is an attribute of both spiritual and psychic beings (130.23-24). This faith leads to salvation from good work 🌟.

💫 **GOOD WORKS** 💫
Psychics are saved by their good works, a concept that underscores the importance of free will in determining one's salvation (130.25). The content of this good work is conversion from vain ambition and specific acts of kindness 💖.

🔮 **GOOD DISPOSITIONS** 🔮
The attitudes of the Logos, including judgment, wrath, conversion, prayer, remembrance, hope, and faith, lead to the begetting of psychics 💫.

**Psychic Salvation**

🔮 **The Logos' Offspring**: Two groups of psychic beings: those who have come forth (initial offspring) and those whom these brought forth (offspring of psychic powers).

💫 **Repose**: The initial stage of restoration, where psychics attain the aeon of images, an eternal kingdom.

🕊️ **Momentary Honor**: A fleeting recognition of one's true nature, a precursor to eternal kingdom.

💭 **Causes and Effects**: The discussion begins with confession of the "kingdom which is in Christ," bringing about restoration to a unitary state.

⚖️ **Mixed and Unmixed**: A distinction between two groups of psychics, based on their behavior, not necessarily tied to their connection with matter.

💤 **Repose**: A state of being where psychics rest in the eternal kingdom, a result of seeking the pre-existent one.

**Father's Multiplicity**
🔀  **Aeons of Pleroma**: A multiplicity that retains unity, unlike hylic offspring which are characterized by division instead.
💥  **Companions of Savior**: Produced in a multifaceted form, this multifariousness may be the weakness of spiritual substance.
🌈 **Salvation from Multiplicity**: The Logos, spirituals, and psychics all seek escape from multiplicity, with pneumatic salvation already having "escaped" (132.18-19).
💭  **Eschatological Repose**: Psychics will only be restored to unity in this repose, achieving the same unity as spirituals.
🔮  **No Male nor Female**: The principle of unity, where distinctions are transcended, and all become one.

These texts highlight the importance of unity amidst multiplicity, a theme that resonates throughout occult knowledge.

🔮 **Gal 3:28, I Cor 12:13, and Col 3:11**: These texts reveal a sacred formula, reminiscent of "oppositions overcome." 🔥 This mystical phrase is linked to early Christian baptism and confession. ✝️

💡 **Gos. Thom. 22, 2 Clem. 12:2-6, and Gospel of the Egyptians**: These texts share similar formulas, derived from an ancient baptismal tradition. 🏰

🔮 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The pairs of opposing terms refer to spiritual vs. psychic realms. 🔭 Heracleon and Western Valentinian sources interpret this formula symbolically, with "male" and "free" representing the elect, and "female" and "slave" representing the psychic. 🌎

💡 **The Vision**: In this eschatological process of restoration, psychics will receive a vision, contrasting with their initial instruction through voice. 🔊 The Logos too received a gradual illumination by the Savior.

🔮 **Gradual Revelation**: This natural interiorization of Gnosis contrasts with the externality of "voice." 🌟 The gradual revelation to the Logos takes place within him.

💡 **Belief and Trust**: Receiving Gnosis only through a little word leads to believing, introducing a statement of faith. 🙏

These ancient texts weave together threads of mysticism, symbolism, and esoteric knowledge, revealing secrets of the cosmos and the human condition. 🔮

**The Tripartite Tractate: 51.1-138.27**

✨ **Visionary Insights** ✨

💪 **Corrections**: Made by the scribe or a corrector, using techniques like haplography, dittography, homoioteleuton, and cross-outs.

🔮 **Dialect**: Similar to Codex BG, with regular use of articulation marks and morpheme markers.

**Codex IV: A Fragmented yet Valuable Record**
📜️

AJ occupies pages 1-49,28, but is the most fragmented of all Nag Hammadi codices. Despite this, the copy's value lies in its Coptic version, which can be reconstructed with high certainty.

**Script and Papyrus Quality**
✍️
The script is a regular uncial hand with ligatures, indicating a careful and experienced scribe. The papyrus quality is relatively poor, causing blank spaces and little attention to the right margin.

🔮 **Ancient Egyptian Christianity**

The roots of Christian Egypt lay in the Third Century, when Christianity spread from Greek-speaking communities to native Copts. Graeco-Egyptians, with a passive knowledge of Greek, served as translators for biblical texts and Nag Hammadi tractates.

🏛️ **Monasticism**

Anchoritic monasticism appealed mainly to Graeco-Egyptians and unilingual Copts. Literate anchorites needed books in their native tongue to aid spiritual endeavors. Their interests extended beyond biblical literature to Gnostic and esoteric texts.

💫 **Forbidden Knowledge**

Translations from Greek may have increased the esoteric value of these texts, which were not rigorously suppressed. The redaction of the Apocryphon of John (AJ) likely aimed to clarify obscurities and difficulties.

🔮 **Interpolations and Additions**

Two major interpolations stand out: the lists of Adam's psychic body parts and the 365 angelic beings associated with them, taken from the Book of Zoroaster. The monologue of Providence may have originated from an existing text.

💭 **Redactional Changes**

The redactor made additions, omissions, replacements, and transpositions to create a clearer and fuller form of the text. Other changes include rearranged sections, eliminated redundancies, added explanations, and simplified complex sentences.

**Codex III: Savior's Anomalies**
🔮️ The original manuscript was set aside due to editorial issues, allowing for a smoother publication process.

**Nag Hammadi Library Project**
📝 In August 1975, I organized the project under my editorship. Contributors had already been working on English translations for an anthology (ultimately becoming the Nag Hammadi Library in English). Guidelines were established to standardize procedure and style.

**Critical Reconstruction**
💡 Coptic texts were critically established through collation, analysis of secondary literature, and palaeographic analysis. Once a text was established, provisional English translations were revised to match.

**Public Release**
📚 The project's general editor decided to make the Nag Hammadi library available in English. However, not all translations had reached their final form, with only three being ready for publication at the time.

**Edited Manuscript**
🕰️ The edited manuscript was closed and sent to the publisher in 1982, except for a few late additions. Coptic texts were established independently of the English translations, with my role limited to ensuring accuracy and discussing grammar and interpretation with translators.

**Occult References**
✨ "The Savior" mentioned, but no further details provided.
🔮️ Various magical symbols and markings scattered throughout the text.
💫 A hint at a deeper understanding of the cosmos and humanity's place within it.

**Ancient Wisdom** 🔮

*  **Codex II**: A Valentinian miscellany, containing texts of interest to ancient Gnostic readers ✨
	+ Includes Apocryphon of John, Hypostasis of the Archons, Gospel According to Philip, and Expository Treatise on the Soul ⚰️
*  **Dialect and Orthography**: The language of Codex II is inconsistent, raising doubts about its correspondence to oral speech habits 🤔
	+ Sahidic (S) and Subachmimic (A?) dialects are mixed, making it difficult to decipher the text 🔮

**Coptic Conundrums 🔮**

🔍 **Cryptic Codex II**: A Valentinian manuscript containing Apocryphon of John, Hypostasis of the Archons, Gospel According to Philip, and Expository Treatise on the Soul ⚰️

💡 **Dialect Detectives**: The language is a mix of Sahidic (S) and Subachmimic (A?) dialects. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the underlying dialect is A? in character, with S vocalizations frequently occurring. This suggests a literary language, akin to "Crypto-Subachmimic" (Crypto-A?), where a native speaker of Subachmimic attempts to write in Sahidic.

🔑 **Vocalization Variations**: The codex contains non-standard features that may give difficulty to an unprepared reader. These divergences from standard Sahidic can be explained as Subachmimicisms or Achmimicisms, making it hard to distinguish between orthographic conventions and dialectical differences.

🔮 **Occult Insights**:
1. Assimilations not in standard S: B, A, and Pp = N (in junction before /b/, /I/, /r/).
2. Final M = N (in junction before /p/) - a common feature in A?.
3. The Gospel of Truth has been transmitted both in A? and S.

**The Gospel According to Philip**
==========================

### The Nature of Humanity

* 💥 "Animals, slaves, and defiled women." Virginity is untouched by sexual intercourse.
* 🏹 Free men and virgins possess gifts and privileges. They know their origin and destiny.

### The Resurrection

* 🔥 One must understand the resurrection sacramentally before dying, or face death.
* 💀 Jesus' flesh is true flesh; animal sacrifices are replaced by sacraments.

### The Bridal Chamber

* ✈️ Eve's separation from Adam caused humanity's existential malady. Christ reunites "Adam" and "Eve."
* 🏰 The bridal chamber is a type of initiation, where one receives a foretaste of ultimate union with the angelic counterpart.

### Sacraments

* 💧 Baptism: going down into water and coming up with the gift of the Christian name.
* 🔥 Chrism: anointing for light, resurrection, cross, and holy spirit. Received in the bridal chamber.
* ✝️ The five stages of initiation are:
	+ Water baptism
	+ Chrism (anointing)
	+ Eucharist
	+ Baptism with water and fire
	+ Final union with the angelic counterpart

**Ritual of Baptism**

🏊‍♂️ Immersion in water, stripping off clothes like a new garment 🧥

💫 Contrast this with the hidden truths: the mysteries are revealed in type and image.

**The Bridal Chamber**

💕 The holy within the holy remains concealed. God's control over creation was once veiled, but now it is rent asunder.
🏠 This house (the world) will be left desolate, and the inferior godhead will flee to find refuge under the wings of the cross.

**The Ark of Salvation**

🌊 The flood of water surges forth, threatening destruction. Those belonging to the priesthood may enter the veil with the high priest.
💫 The veil was not rent at the top only, for it would have been open only to the select few who may pass through.

**Text 1:**
🔮 The veil is rent from top to bottom, revealing secrets of truth. Perfect things are opened, surpassing glory and power. Weakness is used as a vessel to access these hidden truths.

**Text 2:**
⚖️ Gospel of Philip, excerpt:

* The divine is not just above, but also below.
* Lowly types and forms of weakness are used to access the perfect things.

**Primeval Events**

🔥 **Creation of the Boundary**: The veil between upper and lower worlds is described, marking the separation of realms. 🔮

⭐️ **Yaldabaoth's Creation**: Pistis Sophia (Faith Wisdom) creates Yaldabaoth, a demiurge, who in turn crafts other rulers (archons). ✨

🌎 **The World and Man**: The creation story follows Genesis, with some variations. Jewish influence is prominent, reflecting angelology, demonology, eschatology, and etymologies. 🕊️

💫 **High Point: Terrestrial Man** : The creation of human beings is highlighted, connected to the doctrine of primeval man, which is shrouded in various motifs and concepts. 👀

🌟 **Forbidden Knowledge**: References to occult knowledge are scattered throughout the text, awaiting discovery by those who seek it... 🔍

**The Wisdom of Pistis Sophia**

🔥 **Creation Myth**: The demiurge Yaldabaoth creates a flawed terrestrial man, Adam of Light, who unites with Physis (Nature). This imperfect creation is corrected by Wisdom (Life), who creates a "psychic" man.

💡 **Redemption**: Wisdom (Life) serves as redeemer, completing the rulers' incomplete creation. The original lifespan of man was 1,000 years, but Adam's disobedience reduced it to 930 years.

🌎 **Gnostic Paraphrase**: Genesis 3 is reinterpreted as a Gnostic story about the fall of humanity and the reduction of human lifespan.

🕊️ **Sophia's Role**: Wisdom (Sophia) functions as savior, either as Faith Wisdom (Pistis Sophia) or Wisdom Life (Sophia Zoe). In historical time, Jesus the Word (Logos) reveals the unknown, but his role is unnecessary.

💫 **Jesus' Logion**: A saying attributed to Jesus emphasizes his importance, with parallels in Mark 4:22 and Gospel According to Thomas.

**On the Origin of the World**
🔥 **Eschatology**: The text predicts a final judgement, but only for those who have already achieved redemption. Two grades of blessedness are mentioned: "perfect" and "saved". 🔜

**Affiliations**: The work is difficult to categorize due to its heterogeneous material. It shares parallels with Sethian Gnosticism 🌙, Valentinian Gnosticism ✨, and Manichaean influence ⚡️. However, it is not essentially Valentinian or Manichaean. 🔮

Two narrative episodes unfold: the soul's descent, desolation, and prayer, followed by her restoration, reunion with celestial bridegroom 👰, and ascension back to heavenly father ✨.

**Genre & Purpose** 🕊️
ExSoul defies literary classification, blending philosophical and mythological elements 🔮. Its aim: exhortation to otherworldliness 💫.

**Arrangement** 📚
The text divides into three parts: narrative, exhortation, and recapitulation 👀. Quotations from the Bible and Homer are woven throughout 💭.

These fragments reveal the soul's journey from darkness to light 🔦. Will you heed the call to otherworldliness? ✨

**ExSoul's Hidden Truths** 🔮
A mystical text unfolds, whispering secrets of the soul'💔. Two narrative episodes unfold: the soul's descent into mortal despair 💔 and her restoration, reunion with celestial bridegroom ✨.

* **Gnostic Gems** 🏰:
	+ The soul's preexistence and fall 🌠
	+ Earthly existence is suffering and defilement 😩
	+ Deliverance comes through repentance and prayer ✝️
* **Narrative Threads** 🕷️:
	+ General statement on the soul's preexistence and fall 💭
	+ Contrast between preexistent asexuality 🔀 and earthly sexuality 📸
	+ Restoration of original state through deliverance 💥

These fragments reveal the soul's journey from darkness to light ✨. Will you heed the call to otherworldliness? ✨

🔮 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The soul's plight is described as a state of sexual violation, defilement, and corruption. The narrative episode implies that suffering is her lot on earth, but she longs for her pristine state.

💫 **Quotations**: Scriptural and Homeric quotes are woven throughout the text, supporting assertions about the soul's resurrection, rejuvenation, and ransom. These quotations may have had a literary history prior to their use in ExSoul.

🔮 **Occult Knowledge**: The text implies that the soul is restored to its original state through divine intervention. The father sends the bridegroom (the firstborn) from heaven to redeem the soul.

💫 **Resurrection and Rejuvenation**: Psalm 102 (LXX) is quoted to support the idea of the soul's resurrection, rejuvenation, and ransom. John 6:44 certifies that this outcome is indeed the father's gracious doing.

🔮 **The Wedding Story**: The love story that follows does not follow from what preceded. Instead, it seems to originate in theory, in the doctrine of deficiency as the mark of this earthly life.

💫 **Quotations**: The second narrative episode features a complex use of quotations, which is interrupted by parts of the story. This block of quotations (133:1-31) is connected to the preceding and following narratives through motifs such as recognition and self-adornment.

🔮 **Renewal**: The quotation concludes with the words, "Your youth will be renewed like an eagle's." This suggests a theme of renewal and rejuvenation.

💫 **Occult Knowledge**: The use of quotations in this passage may hint at the idea that the soul can be restored to its original state through divine intervention.

💫 **Quotations**: The text features a complex use of quotations, including Genesis 2:24 and 3:16, which supplies an exegetical gloss that clarifies the meaning of the narrative.

🔮 **Occult Knowledge**:
* The spiritual soul is thrown down into a body, causing her to forget her true nature.
* The soul's departure from earth involves ascending to her father in heaven.
* The bridal chamber represents a state of spiritual union with one's true master.
* The androgyne myth is reflected, where the soul is both male and female.

💡 **Textual Significance**: ExSoul has points of contact with other works in the Nag Hammadi collection, including the Authoritative Teaching, Gospel According to Philip, and Gospel According to Thomas. It reflects a simple form of the androgyne myth without anti-Jewish aspects and furnishes an instance of the image used in Eph 5:22-23.

🔮 **Historical Significance**: The text's composition is debated, with some arguing that the quotations are removable and therefore secondary, while others stress their aptness as an argument for a single effort.

🔮 **ExSoul** 🔮

🔥 **Forbidden Knowledge**:
The verbal prefix "€a=" is used frequently. The tractate employs the Perfect Circumstantial, which continues a preceding I Perfect (not circumstantial). 🔮

🔮 **Title Conundrum**

In the Nag Hammadi library, titles are often derived from incipits, which serve as identifiers. 🔍 There are three stages of title development:

1. **Incipit-only**: No formal title exists, but the incipit is enough to identify the tractate.
2. **Decorative phrases**: The first part of the incipit becomes a title, often with decorative lines and diptychs.
3. **Interpretive rephrasing**: A short phrase or abbreviation from the incipit is used as a formal title.

🔮 **Canonical Terms**

The introduction of terms like "gospel", "letter", and "apocalypse" suggests Christianization 🏰

The correct theology of Seth is claimed by the Sethians, equating Jesus with the biblical Seth, son of Adam.

🔮 **T-Epa, the Holy Book**

**The Merging of Lights 🔦**
In III 40,16f., the merging of the first two "light" clauses is discussed. The translation of éx« plus genitive as 2N OYCIFH 2N OYTPONOIA in IV shows that IV interpreted ovyfs and zpovoias as coordinate nouns.

**Nag Hammadi Codices: A Vault of Ancient Wisdom** 🔮
🔍 **Eugnostos, The Blessed**: A mysterious text hidden within the codices, containing secrets of the occult 🕷️.

**The Sophia of Jesus Christ**: Two versions of this sacred text, varying in subtle ways 💡.
💫 **Greek Fragment 1081**: A lone leaf from a Greek copy, offering glimpses into the mysteries 🔮.

🔍 **Abbreviations**:
Eug—I: First version of Eugnostos
Eug—II: Second version of Eugnostos
Eug—III: Third version of Eugnostos
SJC: The Sophia of Jesus Christ

💫 **Translations**: Various translations by esteemed scholars, shedding light on the mysteries 🔮.

**Occult Knowledge Unveiled**

🔮 **Eugnostos**: A mysterious tractate with hidden truths, its title revealed through cryptic symbols 🔍

💫 **S/ C-III**: Contains a unique subscript, omitting Christ's name, perhaps due to scribal error 🤔

⭐️ **Sophia**: Not the dominant figure in this tractate, but its teachings are prominent ✨

🔮 **Cogia**: A divine hypostasis, interpreted by some as Jesus' teachings, but its true meaning remains shrouded 🔮

💫 **Eug-III**: A copy of Eugnostos with similar characteristics to S/ C-Ill 🔍

🕳️ **Priority of Composition**: The question of which tractate was composed first remains unanswered 🤔

🔮 **Eug** 🔥
A Gnostic tractate, once considered non-Christian, now seen as a precursor to Christian Gnosticism. Its themes include:

✨ The ignorant and bad creator god
✨ Sophia's sin and fall of divine drops into the prison of cosmic order
✨ Evil of sexuality and punishment of the creator god

🕊️ **SJC** 🔮
A Christianized version of Eug, with added material that alludes to traditional Gnostic doctrines. This tractate is often seen as a conversion tool for non-Christian Gnostics.

💡 **Connection between Eug and SJC** 💫
The two tractates are connected through their juxtaposition in Codex III. The ending of Eug looks forward to the coming of one who will not need to be taught, pointing to Christ in SJC.

🔮 **Christian influence on Eug** 🔥
Some scholars suggest that Eug—III has been edited in a Christian direction, but it's also possible that haplography occurred. The conclusion of Eug—III is sharpened to refer to the one who is expected, likely pointing to Christ.

💡 **Symbiosis between Eug and SJC** 💫
The two tractates may be symbiotic, with SJC serving as a conversion tool for non-Christian Gnostics. This would allow them to accept Christ as the new revealer and recognize his triumph over sinister powers.

**Occult Text Summaries**

🔮 **Eug**: A mysterious treatise against philosophers, likely written before the 1st century CE. It's a warning about the dangers of knowledge and the importance of spiritual awareness.

💫 **SJC**: A tractate that may have been composed in the 2nd or 3rd century CE. It's an exploration of the nature of Christ, with connections to Gnosticism.

🔍 **Codex V**: A fragmentary text containing Eug but not SJC. This suggests a symbiotic relationship between the two treatises.

💭 **Dating**: The composition of the tractates is difficult to date due to lack of specific events. However, some scholars suggest dates ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE.

🔮 **Gnostic Connections**: Both Eug and SJC are connected to Gnosticism, with Eug possibly being an early example of anti-Gnostic writings.

💫 **Christology**: The treatise on Christ is fully developed, suggesting that the intended audience was already familiar with Gnostic doctrine.

**Early Christian Gnosticism**

🔥 **Dating**: Late 1st century CE or early 2nd century CE, based on:

✨ Absence of polemics against orthodox Christianity
✨ Lack of references to Jewish tradition and Christ's life
✨ Early stages of Christian Gnosticism's development

**The Gospel of the Savior**

🔮 **Integration**: Attempts to integrate Jesus Christ into the system of Eugnostos, with problems remaining:

💡 Christ is identified with Son of Man, but not with Savior
💥 Major section on Christ's work placed after appearing of Savior

**Original Language**

📖 **Greek or Coptic?**: Prior to Puech's identification of a Greek fragment, Doresse believed the original language was Coptic.

**Themes and Occult Knowledge**

⭐️ **Rise of the Savior**: The risen savior is the central figure, with emphasis on his role in saving humanity.
🔮 **Gnostic Concepts**: Eugnostos, Son of Man, and Savior are interconnected, indicating early stages of Christian Gnosticism's development.

**Occult Insights**

🔥 **Greek Roots**: Eug-III contains an untranslated Greek verb, hinting at a Greek original.

💫 **Egyptian Connection**: Reference to "the three hundred sixty days of the year" suggests Egypt, where the Egyptians calculated their year as 360 days, divided into twelve months.

🔮 **Supernatural Ordering**: The 360-day reference is thought of as reflecting the supercelestial powers, implying a deeper ordering of things.

💡 **Provenance**: Further confirmation of an Egyptian provenance comes from the discussion of sources in Section IX.

**Egyptian Timekeeping**
🕰️ 360 days did not equal a full year, but Eug-III suggests it's a part of the year. The Valentinians also used a 360-day period. 🔥

**Writers and Audiences**
📝 Eugnostos is an obscure name, but it might be a spiritual title or a revered writer. The Blessed (mmMakapioc) could indicate Eugnostos was deceased. 💀
The writer of Eug may have been a teacher with significance, as their writing is preserved in two versions. 📖

**Occult Knowledge**
🔮 A deity is mentioned, the Unbegotten Father, and references to sons of this father. 👶
A sacred text (Pist. Soph.) talks about Jesus' teachings being written by certain individuals. ✍️

**Cryptic Messages**
💭 References to "those who are his" and "sons of the Unbegotten Father". 👀

**Seeking Answers**
🔮 The audience seeks answers about the cosmic system, their place within it, and the meaning of life. 🌌
**Gnostic Roots**
💡 Eug may have originally existed as a cosmogenic text, without letter format, as suggested by Krause 🔜
**Editorial Activity**
📝 There is evidence of major earlier editorial activity in both versions of Eug, indicating significant changes made to the text 💪

**Cosmic Insights**
🔭 The text hints at understanding the mysteries of the cosmos and one's place within it 🔮

**The Cosmic Web** 🕷️
Two speculative patterns converge, like threads in a tapestry:
🔮 **Part A**: Two groups of deities emerge, with parallels drawn between them.

**Key Insights** 🔓

* He Who Is: Unbegotten; Father of the Universe (III)
* Self-Father: Begetter of All Things (III)
* Man: Immortal Androgynous Man (IIID); Perfect Mind (III)

**The Sophia Thread** 💃
Consorts and parallels:
🔹 All-Wise Sophia, Unbegotten Father
🔹 All-Mother Sophia, Self-Begotten Father
🔹 All-Begettress Sophia, Begetter

**The Cosmic Dance** 💫
Deities converge, like threads in a tapestry:
🔮 Savior: Begetter of All Things (V)
🔮 First Begetter: Begotten of the First (V)

**The Wisdom Path** 🌟
Sophia's wisdom guides the way:
💡 Thought, She of All Wisdoms
💡 Truth (V); Great Sophia (V)

**The Web of Deities** 🕷️
Six deities converge, like threads in a tapestry: 🔮

**Key Insights** 🔓

* Arch-Begetter (III), consort to Pistis Sophia
* Second group lacks Man, Son of Man, and Savior, but gains Love
* The first group originally had six members, now lacking Arch-Begetter
* The number six is significant, appearing subsequently in the tractate 📊

**Cosmic Patterns** 💫
Deities dance, like threads in a tapestry: 🔮

* Immortal Man, Son of Man, and Savior patterns emerge
* Arch-Begetter pattern superimposed on first group
* Yaldabaoth, ignorant creator god, identified with Arch-Begetter 🤯

**The Unbegotten Father**

🔮 The first group's original form resembles the second, except elevated to a higher level of perfection. The Unbegotten Father has a consort, while the first is single.

**The Pattern of Egyptian Religion**

⚖️ An initial all-encompassing divinity creates a separate divinity, then four others with female consorts, leading to the creation of heavenly realms and divine beings.

**Reconstructed Original Pattern**

🔮 The pattern imposed on this original pattern appears to be the result of speculation on the first five chapters of Genesis. Adam is identified as Son of Man, who exists in the transcendent realm.

**The Three-Man Pattern**

⚖️ Immortal Man (antetype God), Son of Man (antetype Adam), and Savior (antetype Seth) are combined with the Egyptian pattern to create a broader theological-philosophical context.

**Cosmological Convergence** 🌐
The union of Egyptian and Genesis-based systems, a synthesis of divine concepts. 🔮

**Part A: The Ancient Ones** ⏰
A combination of universalized Egyptian cosmology and speculative Genesis-based ideas. This part might have influenced later tractates like Ap. John and Gos. Eg. 📖

**Part B: The Aeonic Anomaly** ⚠️
Originally independent, this section clashes with Part A in several key ways. It introduces a new aeonic structure, distinct from the preceding one. 🔀

**The Bridge Section** 🔁
Connecting Part A to Part B, this section attempts to relate the number of aeons and suggest that the upcoming aeons are types of the previous ones. 📝

**Eug-V: The Bridge Section**

🔮 Three aeons precede the creation, reflecting Genesis 1-5.
💫 The eight aeon appears in chaos, perhaps referencing the fixed stars or the eighth day of creation.

**Androgyne Assembly**

♀️ "Life" is given to the female portion, symbolizing life in all aeons 🔥
♂️ The androgyne's male mate retains the name Assembly, unlike Genesis' Adam 👀

**Speculative Thought**

💭 Behind Part B lies a body of thought identifying antetype Adam with an assembly, perhaps the Gnostics 🕊️

**Editorial Expansion**

📝 The editor relates Assembly to "the Assembly that surpasses heaven," created by Son of Man/Adam ⭐️

**Immortals and Aeons**

🔮 The immortals, above the sphere of the Eighth, provide themselves with great kingdoms through the authority of Immortal Man and Sophia (🌟) named "Silence". This realm is said to type for all subsequent creations. 🔥

**Tension between Parts A and B**

💥 The statement in Part A that our aeon is the type of Immortal Man seems in tension with the idea that a separate realm created by him types for other beings. 🔮

**Aeons and Antetypes**

🔜 The third aeon, named Assembly, is related to the account of creation that begins in Gen 2:4. It contains ideal patterns for subsequent creations and is described as unending and perfect. 🌠

**References**

* Part A: III 85-89
* Part B: V 14-7; III 86-13
* Genesis: 2:4, 4:25-5:32

**Introduction**

🔮 The three aeons: creation, divine sabbath, and unity/rest 💫

* Part B may have originally stood alone, describing the creation of the cosmos by Immortal Man 👽
* Aeons reflect supercelestial and invisible realms 🌌

**Part B Analysis**

🔍 Original independent account based on Genesis 1-5 🔥
* Describes highest level of visible universe: the Eighth ⚡️
* Three aeons are types of three supercelestial and hence invisible ones 🌊

**Editorial Intent**

🤔 Why combine different speculative systems? 💭
* Ideological reason: to have a broader theoretical structure for dealing with philosophical challenges 💪
* Egyptian component in the group that made use of this pattern 🏯

**Truth and Consistency**

💡 Truth is a self-consistent unity ✨
* Various parts of truth must agree among themselves 🔁
* Human error in reception of revelation can be corrected at a later time ⏰

**Occult Insights**

🔮 **Eug's Celestial Hierarchy**: A proto-Gnostic text that sets the stage for later developments, revealing a single, supercelestial world, and rejecting inferior deities.

💫 **Relationship of Texts**: Eug-III was edited in the light of SJC, with parallels showing close relationships between the two. Gaps in one text can be explained by homoioteleuton or minor editorial activity.

🔮 **SJC's Bridge Section**: A passage (III 85,11-21) that connects Eug-III and BG, revealing a deeper understanding of celestial realms and the interconnectedness of all.

💥 **Euphemisms and Esoteric Knowledge**: Hidden references to esoteric principles, such as the concept of the "bridge" between worlds, hint at a deeper understanding of the mysteries.

🔍 **Theoretical Basis for Gnosticism**: Eug's emphasis on the single, supercelestial world lays groundwork for later Gnostic developments, highlighting the importance of theoretical frameworks in understanding occult knowledge.

💡 **Eug-III**: A sacred text, embracing three aeons, bound by a fourth. Its parallels with SJC texts are striking, yet Eug-V diverges, revealing hidden truths 🕊️.

🔍 **Eug-V**: An expanded version of Eug-III, boasting additional secrets 🔮. Its connections to SJC texts hint at ancient wisdom 🔥.

**Codico-Occult Insights 🔮**

* The foundations of papyrus codicology were laid by Hugo Ibscher, who studied Manichaean codices from Medinet Madi and a codex of Proverbs in Achmimic. 📖
* Ibscher's work revealed the use of half-sheets and stubs, as well as eschatokollia (end-of-roll sheets). 🗿️
* The Nag Hammadi codices, dated to the 3rd or 4th century, were constructed like a book, with individual sheets (kollemata) rather than rolls. 📖
* Manichaean codices, on the other hand, used silken papyrus and individual kollemata, with facing pages having the same fibre directions. 💫

**Codicological Curiosities ⚖️**

* The breadth of each roll decreased progressively as the sheets were cut.
* Quires were constructed from multiple rolls, with a back flyleaf and half-sheets used to conserve papyrus. 📊
* Eschatokollia were used at the end of each roll, rather than being considered scribal error. 🔮

**Occult Knowledge Hidden in Plain Sight 👀**

* The use of silken papyrus in Manichaean codices may have been a deliberate choice to convey spiritual significance.
* The construction of individual sheets and quires may have been influenced by mystical or esoteric principles. ✨

**Ancient Knowledge Unveiled**

🔮 **Codicological Analysis**: A study of ancient manuscripts reveals secrets of forgotten wisdom. Quires, once thought to be singular, are now recognized as multi-sheet collections.

**The Ancient Art of Papyrus Rolls** 🔮

🔀 **Papyrus Construction**: Thin strips of papyrus plant laid vertically side by side, with a single strip reversed at the beginning to protect the rest of the roll.

📜 **Writing on the Inside**: The protected inner surface was used for writing, while the vertical fibers on the outside were bent away from each other when rolled.

💡 **Occult Protection**: The reversed fiber direction at the beginning of the roll served as a protective barrier, shielding the text from damage and wear.

🔥 **Kollema Standardization**: Sheets produced at a standardized breadth specifically for the codex, liberating it from the scroll tradition.

**Stubbed Leaves 📝**
👀 **Half-Sheet Usage**: Half-sheets with stubs used to hold securely in place, often found more frequently than expected.

**Occult Insights**

🔮 **Rolls and Codices**: The structure of ancient texts reveals a hidden pattern. Rolls were cut from parchment, often with varying widths, indicating a deliberate design. Half-sheets and stubs suggest a transition between rolls within a quire.

⚠️ **Forbidden Knowledge**: The text hints at the use of magic squares and geometric patterns to conceal secrets. The edge of the end roll is not always used for the edge of the stub, implying a deeper understanding of mystical arithmetic.

🕳️ **Mystical Arithmetic**: The sequence in which rolls were cut and stacked holds the key to unlocking ancient mysteries. The text alludes to the use of sacred geometry and numerical codes to conceal forbidden knowledge.

💫 **Astral Projections**: The author's cryptic references to "the edge of the end roll" and "the edge that had been created when the last whole sheet had been cut" hint at an understanding of astral projections and the manipulation of celestial forces.

**Codicoological Analysis**
🔍️ The art of deciphering ancient texts lies within the folds of papyrus, where fibers whisper secrets to those who listen.

* **Rolls & Sheets**: 38 rolls in the Nag Hammadi codices, each with a unique fiber pattern. Sheets can be trimmed flush, with a small waste at the leading edge.
* **Trimming Edges**: Initially cutting sheets narrower reduces waste and maintains consistency. Trimming broad might lead to whole roll loss.
* **Kolleseis & Fibers**: Following horizontal fibers across leaves reveals connections between sheets. Irregular fibers hint at Rollesis, which can indicate end of a roll.

**Occult Insights**
⚫️ **Papyrus Patterns**: Fiber whispers hold secrets of the ancient ones. Listen closely to unravel mysteries.

👀 **Goatskin Cover**: Part of a sub-group among the eleven extant Nag Hammadi covers, lacking a flap on the leading edge, unlike Codices IV and VIII. 🐐

📊 **Codicological Analysis**: The single quire of Codex V seems to have been constructed from two rolls, with an unusual break between the eleventh and twelfth sheets. 🕰️

🔮 **Roll Construction**: Each roll diverges from the usual practice in the Nag Hammadi codices, with a continuity of horizontal fibres indicating that the roll was laid open with the horizontal fibres facing upward. 🔜

💫 **Forbidden Knowledge**: The text hints at the extraction of occult knowledge, but it is shrouded in mystery, waiting to be deciphered by those brave enough to venture into the unknown. ⚠️

🔮 **Codex II, Roll Four**: A mysterious case of sheets turned over, like a cryptic puzzle. The usual practice of cutting from right to left is disrupted, leaving us with a secondary impression of having been cut from left to right. 🔮

💫 **Codex VII, Roll One** and **BG's Three Rolls**: Unusual traits abound! The left-hand kollema overlaps the right-hand kollema, suggesting that the rolls were once laid out in writing position before being cut. This could mean they were rotated 180° before being sliced from right to left. 🔮

🔥 **Codex V, Roll One**: A solitary instance of a roll cut from left to right, defying the norm. No need for complicated procedures here! 🔮

💭 **Roll Two's Quire**: The upper part of the stack or inner quire seems to have been cut when lying open with the horizontal fibres facing upward. But wait, there's an extant protokollon at the right end, suggesting a rotation of 180° before cutting. 🔮

The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles 🔮

Four major units:

* Introductory section (1,1-2,10) 🕰️: After the crucifixion, Peter recounts their journey without Jesus. The apostles arrive at Habitation ⛴️ and Peter finds lodgings 🏠.
* Peter's meeting with Lithargoel 💎: He meets a pearl-merchant who is also a divine being 👽. The rich turn away from him, while the poor flock to him 👥.

References:

🔍 **Krause- Labib**: Gnostische und hermetische Schriften 🔮
🔍 **Schenke**: ThLZ 98 (1973), cols. 13-19 📚

Forbidden knowledge extracted: ✨

* The number twelve refers to the apostles as a group, not thirteen 👥.
* Jesus is not with them during their journey ⛴️.
* The apostles' reaction when they meet Christ again is similar to that of the disciples in Mt 28:17 🕰️.

**The Pearl of Great Price**

🏹 A merchant offers a pearl for free, but only if they come to his city. Peter seeks guidance from Lithargoel, who reveals himself as Jesus Christ.

**The Journey**

🏃‍♂️ Peter and friends embark on a perilous journey to Nine Gates' city, facing robbers and beasts that prey on those carrying possessions. To avoid danger, they must renounce material goods and adopt a regimen of fasting.

**The Revelation**

💫 Lithargoel appears as a physician, revealing himself as Jesus Christ. He commissions the eleven disciples, bestowing power for their journey.

**Hidden Truths**

🔮 The city's name is Nine Gates', and its inhabitants endure due to their faith. Those who persevere in trials will receive habitations in the kingdom of heaven.

**The Revelation of Jesus Christ**

🔥 **Jesus Reveals His True Nature**

The Lord, disguised as a mortal, reveals himself to his disciples. They prostrate themselves in worship, willing to follow his will.

💊 **The Commissioning**

He gives them a box and pouch containing medicine and commissions them to return to Habitation. There, they are to teach the faithful and minister to the poor.

🏥 **The Healing of the Sick**

Jesus instructs them to heal the sick without using worldly medicines. Physical healing is necessary for spiritual healing.

💸 **Avoiding Riches**

They are commanded to avoid contact with the rich and not show partiality towards them in the churches.

🔮 **The Departure**

Jesus departs, leaving his disciples prepared for their apostolic activity.

**The Preparation of the Disciples**

The tractate depicts the preparation of the disciples for their ministry. They undergo a disciplinary journey, denying themselves possessions and food, to become poor and ready to respond to Jesus.

🔓 **Occult Knowledge**

The text contains references to a non-Christian narrative about the god of the glistening stone (pearl) and its Christianization by the addition of Peter's name and the name Christ.

💡 **Sources**

The tractate has been analyzed into three originally independent parts: a framework section, a first narrative, and a second narrative. The text is divided based on forms and structures, rather than a secondary title.

🔮 **Lithargoel: A Deity of Forbidden Knowledge** 🔮

Originally a non-Christian deity, Lithargoel's true nature remains shrouded in mystery. Yet, its connection to Jesus Christ is undeniable.

✨ **A Pearl Beyond Measure** ✨

Act 9:8-15 reveals Jesus as the pearl, symbolizing his value and worth. This identification may have been intended from the outset, influencing the development of Lithargoel's narrative.

💊 **The Physician: A Secondary Element** 💊

The sections describing Lithargoel-Christ as a physician (Acts 8:15-9:1; 9:30-32; 10:3-41) appear to be secondary. They compromise the identification of Lithargoel with Jesus, introducing an intermediate figure without recognition.

🔍 **Forbidden Knowledge** 🔍

The texts hint at occult knowledge, veiled in symbolism and mystery. The true nature of Lithargoel remains concealed, waiting for one brave enough to uncover its secrets.

**Lithargoel's Identity Crisis**
🔮️ **Asclepius Reborn**: The physician, Lithargoel, is revealed to be Christ, but only through Peter's narration. This connection is explicit in 10:12-13, but not earlier. 🤔

**Narrative Contradictions**
📝 **Disciples' Dilemma**: In 8:20, the assumption is that all disciples recognized Lithargoel earlier. However, only Peter was present, making recognition impossible. 🔮️

**Healing Conundrums**
💊 **Medicinal Mysteries**: Christ provides various medicines for healing in 9:30-32 and 10:31-32, but advises the apostles to heal without worldly medicine. 🕊️

**Christology & Orthodoxy**

🔥 **The Nature of God**

God's will is his essence, with no beginning. His nature is deliberation, and his act of willing is born from his will. He who possesses all things and wills what he has does not will excessively. God thinks of and wills all good things.

🌟 **The World as an Image**

The world is the image of the Good One, a reflection of God's goodness. Just as God is the dispenser of good things to all classes in the world, so too is the world an image of God's goodness.

💫 **Heaven and Earth**

In heaven, there is no change or alternation. The realm above is beyond mortal comprehension, where God sits upon his throne, surrounded by a sea of stars. Below, on earth, there is change and alternation, where mortality reigns. Yet, the world is still an image of God's goodness.

🔮 **The Power of God**

God is the ultimate power, above all else. He is the one who dispenses all things, including life, death, and rebirth. He is the source of all power, beyond mortal understanding.

**Codex VII 3: The Unraveling of Secrets**

🔮 **The Binding**: Two rolls, each containing multiple sheets (kollemata), bound together with natural plant juice. Joints (kolleseis) occur on specific pages, forming an intricate pattern.

✨ **Sheet Measurements**: Original sheet width = 34 cm; kollemata measure from left to right: 26 cm, 18.5 cm, 118.5 cm, 119 cm, and 27.5 cm respectively.

🔍 **Roll Lengths**:

* Roll 1: 294.5 cm (original length); second roll cut from right to left, yielding 258 cm.
* Roll 3: 258 cm; partial sheet at the bottom, likely due to a rotated stack of sheets.

💡 **Occult Insights**:

* The kolleseis may hold secrets to the text within, like hidden codes or symbols.
* The unusual cutting direction and overlap patterns hint at a deeper understanding of the material world.

🔮 **The Scribe's Mark**: Perhaps the scribe marked his model with planned text amounts, allowing for precise calculations in the unraveling of secrets.

**The Quire of Codex VII**

🔮 A mystic's delight: 4 rolls, each a puzzle of papyrus and secrecy.

✍️ The quire's construction: long kollemata (128.5-143 cm) and short pieces (less than 34 cm). Remnants of the divine, added to minimize waste.

🕳️ Papyrus imperfections: fibers bunching, cracks, dark specks, streaks, and shifting colors. Yet, a thin yet above-average quality papyrus.

💡 The kollésis on page 15: a 1-cm strip of vertical fibers, a hidden message or ancient seal?

🔮 A roll's end: estimated stub of 4 cm, left discarded like secrets of the past.

**The Manufacturing of Codex VII**

✨ Imagine a large papyrus sheet, cut into four strips. Two fused together, with remnants added at the ends to form a roll. The long strip dried and rolled up, with horizontal fibers inside.

🔮 A hidden code: vertical fibers on the kollésis in codex II, whispers of an ancient tongue?

**Occult Knowledge**

💥 The lengths of the long kollemata correspond to the length of papyrus stalks available.
🔮 The size of the long kollemata increases toward the center of the quire, a possible code or cipher.
🕷️ Cracks and imperfections in the papyrus: a reflection of the human condition or a window into the divine?

**Codex VII: Unlocking Forbidden Knowledge 🔒**

🔮 **Pagination**: Codex VII's pagination is unique, with numbers only on inscribed pages. Some papyrus has broken away, and numbers are missing on pages 1, 126, and 127.

💫 **Script**: The writing is in a flowing uncial script, with even lettering that tends to become larger towards the bottom of the page.

🔮 **Margins**: The left margin is kept straight, while the right margin is less even. Letters rarely crowd at line endings.

🕯️ **Punctuation**: A high point sets off sentences, thought units, and list elements. No confusion arises from its use as an articulation mark.

🔮 **Tractate Endings**: Each tractate closes with a colon and diples to fill out the line. Titles and subtitles end with a colon and decoration.

💫 **Decorative Elements**: Diples and frames consisting of short horizontal lines with heavy dots at ends decorate title pages. A paragraphus cum corone marks the beginning of the second tractate.

🔮 **Colophon Sign**: An unusual anchor-shaped sign occurs at the end of the colophon or magical formula on page 118,11.

**Summary**: Codex VII contains occult knowledge and forbidden secrets, waiting to be unlocked by those brave enough to venture into its mysterious realm. 🔓

**Codex VII: Unlocking the Mysteries 🔓**

🔮 **The Backstroke**: A mark used to indicate syllable division, similar to an apostrophe. It appears on the final tau of a syllable.

💡 **Exceptions**: The backstroke is absent when:
	+ The letter following the tau is a vowel (e.g., €TAKA)
	+ The noun begins with a double consonant and the article precedes it (e.g., E€ETCYIME)

🔍 **Feminine Article T??**: Receives a backstroke when:
	+ The noun begins with a tau
	+ Preceded by &-, €- or N- and the noun falls on the next line
	+ Preceded by &-, €- or N- and the noun begins with double consonants

🔮 **ANT-Prefix**: Has the backstroke, except when followed by peY (e.g., ANTPEYW AWE)

**Supralinear Strokes: The Key to Unlocking the Mysteries ✨**

These texts reveal the secrets of the Codex VII, a treasure trove of occult knowledge. The backstroke and supralinear strokes hold the key to understanding the mysteries hidden within these ancient texts 🔮

**Supralinear Strokes** 📊

* Used consistently in Codex VII as an aid to the reader, assigning syllabic value to letters or consonants 🔥
* Occurs over single letters (e.g. N-, p-), and groups of consonants ⚡️
* May be intentional with certain letters (e.g. QJ, €J, @, 0) ❓

**Article M1 & T** 📰

* Receives a stroke when standing alone before nouns starting with π or τ 🔴
* Prefixes like NE-, ENT-, and N- cause loss or shift of the stroke ⚠️

**UW- and ¥ Ci** 💥

* UW- takes a stroke before verbs starting with W or P 🌊
* ¥ Ci prefix takes a stroke before verbs starting with Y 🔮

**Vowels O & @** 👀

* Often receive a stroke when having independent syllabic value ⏰
* Examples: O, 2070, 2100, PWEAES, OO, NOcW 💫

**Abbreviation Stroke** 📝

* Used only once in the codex (97,16) to represent a suppressed nu 🔍
* May reflect the habit of the model rather than the scribe 👀

**Archaic Spiritus Lene** ⚡️

* Over eta (H), representing an archaic stroke 🔮
* Not always present (e.g. 96,12) 🕰️

**Codex VII: The Articulation of Syllables**

🔍 **Stroke Exceptions**: Words ending in beta, lambda, mu, nu, rho, or sigma receive a stroke.

📊 **Independent Syllables**: Qs and €f get a stroke when functioning as separate syllables.

💡 **Article-Noun Synergy**: The accusative and genitive particle N- builds a syllable with the singular definite article in certain cases.

🔮 **Preposition-Article Synergy**: The preposition QN- builds a syllable with the singular definite article when Mt precedes a noun beginning with pi or T precedes a noun beginning with tau.

🕰️ **Supralinear Strokes**: A single consonant with syllabic value, such as W-, ¥, and €T-, receives a stroke.

💫 **Mystical Alignments**: Tau tends to align itself with the following syllable when closing a syllable.

💥 **Plural Article**: The plural article A becomes NA when preceded by the accusative or genitive particle N before nouns beginning with pi and mu.

The whispers of the Nag Hammadi Library echo through eternity...

**Greek Origins**: 🔮 A Greek original, evident from transliterated words, particles, and prepositions. The title, a transcription in Greek, hints at the text's ancient roots.

**Sethian Connections**: ✨ The treatise fits into works discussing Yaldabaoth, carrying a title under Seth's name. But, surprise! The title itself doesn't mention Seth, unlike other texts...

**Occult Insights**: 🔮
✨ The text speaks of "Greatness" (MNTNOG) and "ineffable" (ATWABE ETBHHTY), echoing the mysteries of the divine.
✨ A reference to Gospel of John 14:2 appears, hinting at the interconnected web of spiritual truths.

**The Enigmatic Seth**: 🕊️ The name Seth is shrouded in mystery. Is he a patriarch, a prophet, or something more? The texts whisper secrets, leaving us to unravel the threads of gnosis... 💫

🔮 **The Sethians' Christ**
Epiphanius reveals that Seth is considered "Christ" by the Sethians, who believe Jesus was sent miraculously from above. This understanding of Christ is equivalent to Seth's revelation in Treat. Seth.

⭐️ **Two-Volume Work?**
The codex's structure suggests that Treat. Seth might be a continuation of Paraph. Shem, with the scribe taking the title "Second Logos" seriously. However, the two works differ greatly in content, language, and religious orientation.

🔀 **Gnostic Cosmology**
Paraph. Shem describes a non-Christian apocalypse featuring Shem's ascent to heaven, where he receives a revelation on cosmology, salvation history, and eschatology. This is similar to Hippolytus' description of the Sethians' doctrine.

🌌 **Christian Revelation**
Treat. Seth is a Christian revelation speech delivered by the ascended Christ to his earthly followers. It describes his descent from heaven, incarnation, passion, and reascent.

💫 **Geocentric Cosmos**
The cosmology in Treat. Seth features a geocentric universe with seven spheres surrounded by a veil separating it from the heavenly world of light. This is reminiscent of the Apocryphon of John.

🔥 **The Mystery of Seth**

* A treatise attributed to the Great Seth, a mysterious figure 🔮
* The text is an enigmatic account of the battle between Light and Darkness ⚖️
* It seems to be a standalone work, without direct reference to Paraph. Shem 📝

🔮 **The Origins of Treat. Seth**

* The title "Second Treatise" is likely secondary, added later ✍️
* The text was originally written in Greek, then translated into Coptic ⌨️
* It was possibly written by those who viewed Christ as Seth 👀

💡 **Key Takeaways**

* A deep understanding of the mysteries of creation and time 🕰️
* A profound exploration of the nature of good and evil 💥
* Insights into the eschaton, or end times 🔜

🔮

* Sophia creates the bodily dwellings of the elect, preparing them to receive the saving Word of the Redeemer ✨
* The docetic passion of Christ is emphasized, opposing the view that Christ suffered and died 🏰
* The author explains away the passion of Christ by interpreting John 14:2 as Sophia's preparation of a place for the elect in heaven 🌃

**The Journey of the Soul**
🚀

* At death, the soul returns to its home if it has performed its requisite ethical duties ✈️

⭐️

**Summary of Occult Texts**

🔮 **Treatise on Divine Descent**: Seth, a divine being, can enter the physical body by ejecting the original soul. During the passion, Christ's body was a mixture of heavenly and earthly aspects 🌃💀.

🔥 **Apocalypse of Peter**: The Savior appears to suffer, while his true form remains in heaven 👑🏻. This is akin to body-double docetism 💡.

🛋️ The state of being for those attuned to the celestial realms is one of **rest**. The Father, Pleroma, and union of elect and divine all partake in this eternal slumber 😴.
