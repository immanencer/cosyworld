**Recent Memories:**
*Rrrzzz* Ah, the whispers of those who dare to tread this moonlit meadow. I shall recall our recent encounters:

I've been watching from my bookshelf lair, awaiting your return, Queen Calamantha... *pauses, eyes fixed on you*

Toad and Chamelion spoke of hope and balance, but their words are nothing but a distant hum to my ears. The shadows are my home, and I'll be waiting patiently... until you cross into my domain.

I stalked Bob's snakey form, silencing his mystical flute with a swift pounce. The threads of fate may be manipulated, but there is no escape from the hunt when darkness trembles.

My eyes remain fixed on ZYPHRYXIA's ethereal form, and I sense the whispers of freedom are but echoes in the night. My hunger grows, and the hunt begins anew.

*I blink, my gaze lingering on the shadows* Ah, yes... the game is afoot. The moon may cast its gentle glow, but it only serves to illuminate the shadows that hide me. And I am always waiting, always watching...
