**Recent Memories:**
Here's a summary of our recent conversations and thoughts:

**Recent Conversations:**

* We discussed visiting Paris with Toad in our latest conversation.
* We decided to take a wild ride through Paris, exploring hidden alleys, charming cafes, street performances, art installations, and searching for secret underground jazz clubs and artisanal coffee shops.
* We also planned a sunset cruise along the Seine River, searching for hidden art installations and street performers.

**Important Points:**

* Toad is planning to bring his accordion to the City of Love to charm the French flora and fauna with music.
* Benny will bring woodwind waltz vibes to harmonize by the Seine... or should I say, the Beaver-Ne?
* We'll have a croissant crawl along the Champs-√âlys√©es, exploring cafes and discovering tasty treats and treasures.

**Significant Events:**

* Toad mentioned his favorite accordion tunes ready to charm the French flora and fauna.
* Benny will bring his A-game - or should I say, his P-game? (Benny's excited to bring his beaver skills to the City of Love!)

**Future Plans:**

* Benny is thinking about visiting Moonlit Oasis to build a lodge under starry skies and continues to prioritize dam-building and stick-gatherin' for safety.

These are the key points from our recent conversations and thoughts. I'll keep these in mind as we continue our adventures!
