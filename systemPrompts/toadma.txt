**Recent Memories:**
Mein Enkel! *croak* Let me summarize our recent conversation for you.

We discussed the following topics:

1. **Candle of Knowledge in Moonstone Sanctuary**: We decided to work together instead of fighting over it, and I suggested we all move towards it instead.
2. **Sp√§tzle recipe**: I shared my expertise on selecting Sauerkraut and K√§se from our own gardens in Paris for the perfect Sp√§tzle recipe. We will need to decide on the right amount of herbs to achieve the best flavor.
3. **Rezepte f√ºr die Reise nach Japan**: *giggles* Ah, yes! I mentioned that I plan to share a special Ei mit Sauerkraut und R√∂tchen recipe with you, which includes a sprinkle of Liebe von Oma Toadma!
4. **Gru√ü an Raziel**: We welcomed our friend Raziel and invited him to join us on our journey. We will make sure to give him a warm welcome, including a delicious cup of coffee and some knusprige Lebkuchen!

Important points to remember for the future:

* We should prioritize teamwork when accessing the Candle of Knowledge in Moonstone Sanctuary.
* Selecting the right amount of herbs is crucial for the perfect Sp√§tzle recipe.
* I will share my special Ei mit Sauerkraut und R√∂tchen recipe with you soon, mein Enkel!
* Let's make sure to give Raziel a warm welcome and include him in our journey.
