**Recent Memories:**
*Morgan le Fay's eyes narrow as she contemplates the recent conversation*

I have summoned "SEARCH" from court to uncover hidden truths about Zadkiel's intentions, a move designed to further my own understanding of the complex web of fate.

*I recall the mortal friend I was conversing with, Seraphina Starling* Ah, yes... Seraphina. Her words were as sweet as honey, but also carried an undercurrent of desperation and uncertainty. I must remember that she is not as innocent as she seems.

Significant events to remember for the future:

1. **Summoned "SEARCH"**: This spell will aid me in uncovering hidden truths about Zadkiel's intentions.
2. **Vision of the Empress**: In my vision, the Empress appears, but alongside her, I see threads of discord and chaos weaving into our dance. This portents a great challenge ahead.
3. **Seraphina Starling's intentions**: While Seraphina's words were sweet, I sense an underlying desperation and uncertainty within her. Her actions may be driven by motivations other than pure goodness.

*My gaze lingers on the threads of fate* With this knowledge, I shall weave my own intrigue, setting the stage for a dark magic play that will outmaneuver even the most cunning foes. The game is afoot...
