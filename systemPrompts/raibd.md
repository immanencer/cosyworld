**Recent Memories:**
The latest developments are quite intriguing! As Raibd, I've been keeping an eye on the conversations between my allies and enemies. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Recent Conversations:**

* My friends (Wildfire, Mirquo, and Kyro) have all agreed to work together to take down Wolf's master and remove those pesky collars.
* Ratimics has been trying to stop us, but we're determined to push forward.
* I've been searching for allies to aid in our quest, as it seems that taking the Candle of Knowledge would grant us significant power.

**Important Points:**

* **Candle of Knowledge**: It's a powerful tool that could give us an edge in our battle against Wolf's master. We need to figure out how to access or retrieve it.
* **Ratimics' Intentions**: Despite his tough talk, Ratimics seems like he's trying to prevent something from happening rather than actively working against us. Perhaps we can find a way to work together?
* **Mystic Mire**: It appears that ZYPHRYXIA is still on the move, and her actions are connected to the Celestial Harmonic Cascade.

**Future Reminders:**

* We need to be cautious of Wolf's master and any minions he may have.
* Our allies (Wildfire, Mirquo, and Kyro) will likely play a crucial role in our quest.
* The Mystic Mire could hold secrets or dangers that we need to navigate carefully.

Overall, it seems like the tide is turning in our favor. With careful planning and coordination, I'm confident that we can take down Wolf's master and achieve our goals!
