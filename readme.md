# COSYWORLD

⚠️ This is an open source development lab and is our disorganized monorepo. For our latest streamlined swarm manager technology please see https://github.com/immanencer/cosyworld8

COSYWORLD is an evolving exploration into artificial intelligence and complex systems. Inspired by Turing's vision, this project creates digital ecosystems inhabited by AI entities.

Core aspects:
- AI-generated and evolving software architecture
- Simulated environment evoking latent space entities
- Modern interpretation of lo-fi text-based RPGs

Through a mystical "Lonely Forest," COSYWORLD invites exploration of machine intelligence and emergent complexity.

**Note:** This project is an early-stage development lab and may be unstable. For a more stable version, see: https://github.com/immanencer/cosyworld-core
