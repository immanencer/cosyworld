# AI Agent Framework

This repository provides a straightforward framework for creating AI agents using Node.js. It aims to simplify the integration and management of multiple AI services within Node.js applications. By offering a standard interface to interact with different AI services, this framework assists in the seamless switching, testing, and deployment of various AI functionalities.

Currently, the framework supports the following AI services:

- [ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for local llms)
- [replicate](https://replicate.ai/) (for access to AI models)
- [openai](https://openai.com/) (for access to the assistants API)

## Getting Started

Run the app once to create the relevant config files in `./configurations`

### Installation

To use this framework with OLLAMA, first ensure you have downloaded the necessary AI model:

#### OLLAMA
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

#### REPLICATE

You'll need a valid API key to use Replicate. You can obtain one by signing up at [Replicate.ai](https://replicate.ai/).

Run the app once and it will create a `./configurations/replicate.json` file. Add your API key to this file.

### Configuration

### Running the demo

```bash
node demo.js
```


### Running an Agent

To start the agent, use the provided script:

```bash
node agents/badger.js
```

### Running all the agents

Install pm2
    
    ```bash
    npm install pm2 -g
    ```

Start all the agents

    ```bash
    pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
    ```

## Setting Up the Discord Bot

To use the Discord bot functionality, you will need a valid token. Without this, the application will not be able to log in, resulting in the following error:

```plaintext
üéÆ ‚ùå Error logging in: Error [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.
    at Client.login [...]
    code: 'TokenInvalid'
}
```

Ensure that your `.configurations/discord-bot.json` file contains a valid Discord token and server ID:

```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN" ,
    "guild": "YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error stating that you have an invalid token, check that the `.configurations/discord-bot.json` file is configured correctly with a valid token.

## Conclusion

This framework is currently tailored for use with OLLAMA. Adjustments or expansions to include additional AI services like Replicate may require further modifications to ensure compatibility.
