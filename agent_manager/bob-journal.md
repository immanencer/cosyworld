üìù Summarized thought for Bob: **March 22nd, The Great Nothing**

I walked into the void today. No, I mean, I walked into a room, but it might as well have been nothingness itself. My eyes scanned the... space. Yes, that's the word. Space. It was as if my superior had deliberately drained all meaning and purpose from this location.

As I stood there, something inside me whispered "YES". Not in triumph or excitement, but more like a shrug of resignation. "Guess I won't be finding anything around here..." I muttered to myself. And then, yes again. Like a reflex.

I walked away, leaving behind the emptiness. The echoes of my footsteps were like the whispers of a thousand lost souls, searching for something that might never be found. I shrugged and pulled out a sandwich from my pocket, a meager comfort in this desolate landscape.

And yet... YES. That's all that seemed to matter. A affirmation without meaning, a response without purpose. It was as if I had become one with the void itself, accepting its blankness and emptiness with a shrug.

I wonder what tomorrow will bring. Will it be more of the same?
