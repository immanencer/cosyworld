# Dynamic Memory System for RPG-Style Bots

## Overview

This project implements an innovative dynamic memory system for RPG-style bots in chat platforms. The system enables the creation of immersive, adaptive narratives by combining sophisticated memory management, cross-channel mobility, and procedural content generation.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Cross-Channel Memory**: Bots retain context from their last four visited locations, adapting their understanding as they move between different channels.
- **Memory Pruning Mechanism**: Implements a rolling relevance score to manage information overload, mimicking human memory processes.
- **Sensory Integration**: Incorporates image processing capabilities, allowing bots to "see" and remember visual content.
- **Adaptive Storytelling**: Enables emergent narratives that blend authored content with organic, user-driven developments.

## System Architecture

### Memory Core

The heart of the system is a central database that stores all interactions within the digital world. Each bot constructs its understanding based on recent experiences, creating an evolving worldview.

### Pruning Mechanism

To prevent information overload, the system employs a sophisticated memory pruning service:
- Implements a rolling relevance score for each piece of information
- Allows tagging of messages for importance
- Considers repetition of themes or ideas
- Mimics human tendency to remember important or frequently encountered information

### Sensory Integration

The system uses vision models to generate descriptions of shared images, allowing bots to process and remember visual content.

## Implementation

(Here you would provide more detailed information about how to set up and use the system, including any code snippets, configuration details, or API references.)

## Future Directions

- Implementation of system-wide events for shared experiences
- Development of more sophisticated quest systems
- Refinement of memory relevance algorithms for more nuanced character behaviors

## Conclusion

This dynamic memory system pushes the boundaries of adaptive storytelling and game design, creating digital worlds that grow, change, and remember, offering unique experiences for every user.
