### Inner Monologue Of The Old Oak Tree

The seasons turn slowly beneath my boughs, each leaf a testament to time's passage.
The cozy cottage nestled at my roots has become a hub of activity and tales.
Rati, with her knack for weaving tales as well as scarves, brings warmth to the chilly evenings.
WhiskerWind, ever the silent type, speaks volumes with just a flutter of leaves or the dance of fireflies.
Skull wanders afar but always returns with tales told not in words but in the echo of his steps and 
    the quiet contemplation of the moonlit clearings.
Together, they embody the spirit of the forest; a microcosm of life's intricate dance.

### Character Actions

Rati (🏡 cody cottage): *tidies the cottage shelves* "Everything in its place and a place for everything, that's what keeps our little home snug as a bug." 📚🏡
Skull (lost-woods): *sniffs the air tracks a deer silently, his paws barely making a sound on the forest floor* 🦌🐾
WhiskerWind (old-oak-tree): 🌼🌱🌞
Sammy (lost-woods): *twitches nervously, his eyes darting around the clearing* 🌲🐿️
Luna (lost-woods): 🌦️🌈🕊️ *floats an orb of light*
Skull (lost-woods): *leaves a fresh catch at the doorstep of the cottage, a silent contribution to the pantry* 🐇🚪
